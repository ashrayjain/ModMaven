Development poses a great challenge to nature conservation and Singapore is an excellent model to study how a balance can be achieved. Students will be introduced to the country?s natural heritage, its historical, scientific and potential economic value. You will have the opportunity to explore important habitats, and to think critically about the issues of sustainable development and the nation?s responsibility to posterity and to regional and international conventions related to biodiversity conservation. Students are expected to undertake the field trips on their own and at their own time within the semester; and will be encouraged to ?self-learn?. A special website with information on the places to visit and their significance serves as a semi-interactive IT-resource. Suggested trails and what can be observed appear on the website. The students? independence and experiential learning aspects are strongly encouraged.",

Examples of concurrent systems are parallel programs that describe sets of collaborating processes. This module introduces the design, development and debugging of parallel programs. It will build on the concurrency concepts gained from the Operating Systems module. It covers concepts and modelling tools for specifying and reasoning (about the properties of) concurrent systems and parallel programs. It also covers principles of performance analysis, asynchronous and asynchronous parallel programming, and engineering concurrent systems and parallel programs.",

    "description": "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of Evolution This bold statement by the Russian population geneticist T. Dobzhansky emphasizes the importance of evolution as the only unifying concept in biology. Yet, the theory of evolution is more controversial and opposed by more forces in society than any other theory in science. The module will revisit many of these objections and reveal that they are based on reasoning that is incompatible with the principles of science. We will investigate, why it is \"Neo-Darwinism\" and not \"Intelligent Design\" that is currently the best supported paradigm for explaining \"adaptation.\" We will then challenge the power of the neo-Darwinian paradigm by asking how seemingly incompatible phenomena like altruism and excessive male ornamentation can possibly be explained by natural selection. We will also study several key events in evolution such as the origin of sex and its numerous consequences and the origin of the human species. We will conclude with discussing the importance of the theory of evolution for understanding cultural evolution (\"memes\") and human health and senescence (\"Darwinian medicine\").",

    "description": "Sign processes permeate the lives of all creatures in the natural world. Sign use makes possible not only such higher-order human abilities as spoken language and written texts, but also underlies such communicative animal behaviour as the calls and songs of birds and cetaceans; the pheromone trails of insect colony organisation and interaction; the mating, territorial, and hierarchical display behaviour in mammals; as well as the deceptive scents, textures, movements and coloration of a wide variety of symbiotically interacting insects, animals and plants. This course will introduce you to the recently developed field of biosemiotics the interdisciplinary study of sign processes as they occur variously across the biological spectrum. Looking at the close relation between living systems and their sign systems (hence the term: bio-semiotics), this still-emerging discipline seeks to traces the evolutionary development of sign-mediated ways of being in the world from its beginnings in the transmission of information across single cells to its most complicated realisation in the abstract forms of human thought.",

These are followed by analyses for convective heat transfer and heat transfer with phase change, and subsequently radiative heat transfer. Heat exchangers and their design are discussed. Steady and unsteady-state molecular diffusion is studied, while convective mass transfer is analyzed using exact and approximate integral analysis. Finally, analogies between mass, heat and momentum transfer are discussed leading to the concept of transport phenomena.",

Public understanding of Darwin and evolution remains a serious problem. What most people think they know about Darwin, his life and his famous book \u2018On the origin of species\u2019 is wrong. This module, requiring no background in biology or science history, will provide a solid background for understanding how the history of the theory of evolution actually unfolded. The course covers the history of geology, paleaontology and biology from the 1700s to the 20th century. The central focus is on the life and work of Charles Darwin (1809-1882) and how biological evolution was uncovered and accepted by the international scientific community in the 19th century, and beyond. There are case studies on how to assess historical claims and evidence. The final 3 or 4 lectures discuss recent developments in evolutionary biology.",

It also examines the roles played by colonial authorities and the 'China connection' in the development of these business networks. Specific case studies are drawn on to allow a closer understanding of the way Chinese businesses were established and how they developed. The social, economic and cultural aspects closely associated with the Chinese business community of Singapore, such as early Chinese migration, dialect organisations, guilds, occupational structure, Chinese merchant culture, as well as the transformation and globalisation of Chinese businesses will also be discussed.

Models and analytical skills are introduced in order to solve business problems systematically.Information technology and the Internet have made many changes in the way businesses are run, and Managerial Economics has changed significantly with it. We now devote a new portion of this course to discussing how network effects propel the information age, resulting in significant monopoly powers such as Microsoft.

This emphasises the sharing of natural areas and resources among nation-states and their peoples in Southeast Asia given the historical background of the region with its impact on national borders and the composition of both the population and society. The outcome on nature and society relations seen in Southeast Asia reflect conditions specific to the region and its geography. This module is aimed at understanding both these specific conditions and the wider as well as external factors that have an impact on environment in Southeast Asia.",

It revolves around a series of talks given by invited speakers, organised into three strands: (i) the academic strand, which introduces various areas and modes of academic inquiry; (ii) the professional strand, which introduces various professions and looks into the nature of the knowledge society; (iii) the social strand, which examines an individual's intellectual and social engagement with the increasingly interdependent world. Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions. The module reinforces skills learnt in Writing and Critical Thinking, and allows students to apply them to a diverse range of issues. Assessed on a CS/CU basis, the 4-MC module is completed in two semesters (student's Semester 2 &amp; 3). Students are required to attend at least nine talks (minimum four per semester), participate actively in discussion, and submit four short response papers and two longer papers. Students will have to perform satisfactorily in each of these assessment modes. No partial MC will be given.

A common theoretical literature base is examined and tested against both the EU and ASEAN, using concepts such as &quot;integration&quot;, &quot;regionalism&quot;, &quot;international organisation&quot;, &quot;security communities&quot; and &quot;inter-governmental bargaining&quot; to explain the genesis, functions and utility of ASEAN and the EU. The focus is on the international bargaining, diplomacy, trade negotiations and relations of the EU and ASEAN with the great powers (especially the US, China, Japan, Russia) and with each other. Some background in Asian studies, European studies, International Law, or International Relations would be helpful to the prospective student.",

Students are encouraged to reflect critically about their own experiences as men and women who live in a gendered world, to think through the implications of gender: how women's experience may challenge some fundamental assumptions regarding human nature, femininity and masculinity, sexuality and the body, public and private life, subjectivity and representation. We will explore how these challenges to philosophy may be met.",

    "description": "Effective marketing research is necessary for successful management of all phases of the marketing process, ranging from product development and introduction to selling through growth and maturity stages. In today's information-oriented environment, a marketing manager cannot succeed without a thorough understanding of the research process. By understanding the research process, he can better judge the suitability, reliability and the validity of a research study in his decision-makings. Students will learn by doing in this course. While we will use class time to discuss appropriate research topics, students are required to do lots of activities by themselves in order to facilitate their learning by doing. In doing so, this course incorporates an experimental element in marketing research and consulting. As a marketing information provider, students will be assisting a firm by collecting and interpreting market data as a means toward the development of a superior marketing plan. At the same time, students will conduct tutorial activities that will provide opportunities for students to practice the key topics covered in the class. This course is intended to acquaint students with the fundamental marketing research process. More specifically, this course aims: (i) To familiarise the student with the fundamental marketing research skills of problem formulation, research design, questionnaire design, data collection, data analysis, and report presentation and writing. (ii) To have the student gain perspective and practice in applying these skills through a research project. (iii) To develop an understanding of decision making in marketing, its inherent difficulties and pitfalls and the importance of information in marketing research.",

    "description": "The purpose of this seminar is to introduce students to the roles of randomness in scientific thinking. Some of the topics covered include the following: 1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren\u2019t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?",

The course will uncover the practical value of T&amp;D (training and development) methods and learning theories/concepts to promote continuous learning in organisations. Students are expected to be knowledgeable about the field of human resource development (HRD) and the systematic approach to employee T&amp;D efforts by the end of the module. The module is highly application oriented and student assessment will be based solely on the experiential exercises designed for the module. Both students presentation skills and knowledge about training and development will be assessed. This module is designed to equip students for the roles of HR (human resource)/training specialists and/or non-HR managers/executives/supervisors with training and development responsibilities. Hence, this module does not require students to have taken an HRM (human resource management) module before, i.e., HRM is desired but not a compulsory prerequisite to this module. Note however that Lesson 10 requires students to apply basic HRM concepts when dealing with the lesson on Selecting and Managing Trainers.

A military strong enough to defend the state from external enemies is also strong enough to seize power. How can a state have a strong military capability without being dominated by it? How do political leaders and military organizations interact with each other and with the larger society, and how do their cultures overlap and diverge.",

They will explore both language patterns that distinguish their own writing and the influence of digital communication\u2014blogging, tweeting, texting, etc.\u2014on language change. Analyses of different linguistic environments will be facilitated by the use of new, computer-aided tools, as well as through reading, discussing, and responding to relevant articles. Through their analyses students will develop their awareness of the ways writers attend to the demands of different rhetorical situations, and then apply these insights to their own arguments.",

Demand forecasting drives the effective planning of the supply chain: personnel requirements, capital investment, production schedules, logistics etc.This module surveys forecasting techniques and their applications. These encompass traditional qualitative (e.g. front line intelligence, Delphi method) and quantitative techniques (e.g. regression, time series) as well as emerging techniques based on neural networks. Concepts such as trends, seasonality and business cycles will be discussed. Their value in improving forecasts will be illustrated. The module makes extensive use of software including MS Excel and dedicated forecasting packages.",

We formulate linear programming (LP) problems and solve them by the simplex method (algorithm). We also look at the geometrical aspect and develop the mathematical theory of the simplex method. We further study problems which may be formulated using graphs and networks. These optimization problems can be solved by using linear or integer programming approaches. However, due to its graphical structure, it is easier to handle these problems by using network algorithmic approaches. Applications of LP and network optimization will be demonstrated. This course should help the student in developing confidence in solving many similar problems in daily life that require much computing. Major topics: Introduction to LP: solving 2-variable LP via graphical methods. Geometry of LP: polyhedron, extreme points, existence of optimal solution at extreme point. Development of simplex method: basic solution, reduced costs and optimality condition, iterative steps in a simplex method, 2-phase method and Big-M method. Duality: dual LP, duality theory, dual simplex method. Sensitivity Analysis. Network optimization problems: minimal spanning tree problems, shortest path problems, maximal flow problems, minimum cost flow problems, salesman problems and postman problems.",

The dynamics of technological change are explored through concepts such as technological dominant designs, disruptive technologies and diffusion curves. Students will learn the process through which an innovative idea is transformed into a marketable product or service, as well as the organisational and strategic factors that influence this process. These include ways to encourage risk-taking and creativity, discover market opportunities, protect intellectual property, attract resources, nurture entrepreneurial leadership, and overcome resistance to change. These concepts are brought to life using case studies, videos and guest speakers.",

Emphasis is also given to recent discussions about how diversity and difference in the perception and use of space pose a challenge to the utilitarian and functional definition adopted by the state.",

This ensures that a student has gained some familiarity with the exploration of topics in an inter-disciplinary, multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary fashion. The student should approach a College Fellow to work out an agreed topic, readings, and assignments for the module. Part of this conversation should be to specify in what sense the topic and/or approach are interdisciplinary, multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary in character. A formal ISM contract is to be submitted to the Director of Studies for approval. Evaluation is based on 100% Continuous Assessment and must be worked out between the student and the supervisor prior to seeking the College\u2019s approval. In the course of the semester, between 4 and 6 meetings between student and supervisor are expected. The student is expected to play an active role in setting the agenda and preparing for these meetings.",

Lay people and philosophers alike ascribe sacred values to people\u2019s capacity for conscious thoughts, reasoning, and behaviour. However, social psychology research demonstrates the powerful influence of the unconscious, mechanisms that occur without conscious awareness, on high-level mental processes. In this module, students will be exposed to an array of research revealing how the unconscious affects social perception, social behaviour, goal pursuit, and complexed decision making. Students will acquire a basic understanding of how the unconscious operates and appreciate the real-life implication of the unconscious in consumer behaviour, public opinion, and legal decisions.",

    "description": "Cultural contacts between South Asia and Southeast Asia started around the 3rd c AD. Especially several South-Indian dynasties (as, e.g. the Pallavas and the Cholas), under which trade and the setting up of diplomatic ties flourished, were the main responsible forces for an early spread of Indian cultural and social concepts and values beyond South Asia \u2013 and especially to Southeast Asia. The module aims at looking at those early forms of contact between the two regions, and at providing an understanding of the concepts of \u201ckingship\u201d, society, religion and culture, that became shared as a consequence.

An analytical approach will enable you to: (1) identify alternative marketing options and actions, (2) calibrate the opportunity costs associated with each option, and (3) choose one or more options that have the highest likelihood of helping you achieve your business goals. By completing this course, you will be well on your way to making the ROI case for marketing expenditures that companies are increasingly asking of their executives. This course follows up on the marketing core course by operationalizing several marketing concepts such as segmentation, targeting, positioning, and marketing resource allocation. By the end of this course, you will learn how to segment customers, recognize different ways to segment markets, understand the data required for segmentation, identify attractive customers to target, determine the best positioning of your brand in customers\u2019 minds, and develop new products that add value to consumers and firms. The course is designed for students who have extensive background in or understanding marketing research and marketing principles, and who know or are prepared to learn to build \u201csmart\u201d spreadsheets in EXCEL. Using market simulations and related exercises tied to PC-based computer software, students will develop marketing plans in varying decision contexts.",

It discusses implementation aspects of fundamental programming paradigms (imperative, functional and object-oriented), and of basic programming language concepts such as binding, scope, parameter-passing mechanisms and types. It introduces the language processing techniques of interpretation and compilation and virtual machines. The lectures are accompanied by lab sessions which will focus on language processing tools, and take the student through a sequence of programming language implementations. This modules also covers automatic memory management, dynamic linking and just-in-time compilation, as features of modern execution systems.",

Examples are plentiful, such as \"Molecular Biology\", \"Molecular Genetics\", \"Molecular Electronics\", \"Molecular Medicine\", \"Molecular Informatics\", \"Molecular Engineering\", \"Molecular Pharmacology\", \"Molecular Ecology\", \"Molecular Machines\"... etc. In the \"Science of Molecules\" viz. \"Chemistry\", the focus is on molecular design, molecular structure, molecular synthesis, molecular activity and molecular function. The function depends on the activity, which in turn is governed by the design and structure. Chemical synthesis is generally guided by good structural design. Molecular structures therefore are the fundamentals in molecular science. In this seminar series, we shall discuss with the class the underlying principles of chemical structures, with specific focus on the interrelationship among the five S's of molecules -Science, Structure, Stability, Symmetry, and, Space. The mode of teaching and learning focuses on group learning, interaction, independent enquiry, project work, molecular models, and public presentations. Writing and presentations are essential elements in this freshmen seminar. There will also be hands-on sessions on molecular models and molecular origami.

In particular, the four big theorems in functional analysis, namely, Hahn-Banach theorem, uniform boundedness theorem, open mapping theorem and Banach-Steinhaus theorem will be covered. Major topics: Normed linear spaces and Banach spaces. Bounded linear operators and continuous linear functionals. Dual spaces. Reflexivity. Hanh-Banach Theorem. Open Mapping Theorem. Uniform Boundedness Principle. Banach-Steinhaus Theorem. The classical Banach spaces : c0, lp, Lp, C(K). Compact operators. Inner product spaces and Hilbert spaces. Orthonormal bases. Orthogonal complements and direct sums. Riesz Representation Theorem. Adjoint operators.",

The intermingling of people, the exchange of ideas and international commerce have been part of Southeast Asian life for centuries. This module surveys the broad currents of conflict, change and continuity across the region from a multidisciplinary perspective. It looks at how Southeast Asian societies and political systems have changed over time in response to the pressures of ecology, colonialism, nationalism, urbanization and globalization. The module also looks at the way ethnic, religious, national and regional identities have been constructed, used and altered over time. The overall objective is to provide students with an introduction to different ways of exploring Southeast Asia and different experiences of living in the region.",

What can robots do to avoid running into people walking around? How do molecules change shapes over time? This module presents a coherent computational framework for this type of questions. The foundation of the framework and the state-of-the-art algorithms are illustrated in the context of several important applications, including robotics, computational biology, and computer animation. The module covers both classic results and, selectively, advances from recent research.",

Continuing from Part I, we will be discussing Later Mohist Logic, Gongsun Long and other \u2018Sophists\u2019, Zhuangzi, Xunzi and Hanfeizi in this module. The approach of the course will be both historical and critical, and we will attempt to both situate Classical Chinese philosophical discourse in its intellectual-historical context and to bring out its continuing relevance.",

Concepts to be discussed include: grammatical categories, grammatical functions, semantic relations, and their hierarchical composition in sentences; various other syntactic and semantic notions; and the relationship between grammar and meaning. A key feature of the module is its emphasis on the evidence and argumentation that bears upon the representation of structure and principles of grammar that we postulate. The module is obligatory for EL Majors, and provides the foundation for the study of advanced modules in syntax and semantics.",

New and emerging techniques in research have pushed forward our understanding of physiology, pharmacology and pathology, paving the way for fundamental changes in diagnosis and treatment. As medical research has developed, it has also raised important questions for researchers, clinicians, legislators and the public. Important topics covered will include the progress and pitfalls of the human genome project and how advances in biochemistry have informed our understanding of human disease. The course will also cover revolutionary advances in neuroscience, the cardiovascular and metabolic system, and cancer, and how these have shaped our understanding of human disease. The transfer of information gathered in basic science research to the clinic will be examined, along with the impact this has had on society as a whole. Students will learn some of the basic scientific and clinical principles underlying these advances, and will examine how they are placed in a medical, social, legal and ethical context. Students will develop a better understanding of how science and medicine interact with society and the community.",

During the course, various types of consumer research will be introduced. While students should learn to recognize what types of consumer research are valuable for specific marketing decisions, the course does not focus on the technical aspects of research design.

Examples may include the three large collections of Chinese vernacular stories, Common Words to Warn the World (Jingshi tongyan), Constant Words to Awaken the World (Xingshi hengyan) and Clear Words to Inform the World (yushi mingyan), collected or written by Feng Menglong (1574-1646). Significant chapters from the three collections will be selected for intensive reading and close analysis. The reason for the rise of the vernacular story as well as the relationship between the author/editor and the stories will be discussed in the course. Some cases of the evolution from earlier versions to those collected in later periods will be explored. The narrative characteristics applied in the collections will be explained. Several thematic designs in the texts will also be interpreted.",

Organisational behavior is a field that draws ideas from psychology, social psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and management and applies them to the organisation. The field of organisational behaviour covers a wide range of topics: organisational culture, motivation, decision making, communication, work stress and so on. In the end, the field of organisational behavior asks two questions: (1) why do people behave as they do within organisations? (2) how can we use this information to improve the effectiveness of the organisation?",

First, concepts in cellular networking, including the various generations of cellular networks are introduced. Important concepts related to the design of air interfaces, MAC protocol, QoS, spectrum allocation, mobility management are presented. Second, the students are introduced to the emerging area of sensor networks. Here, the major topic covered are MAC, routing and transport protocols. In this module, there is a strong emphasis on exposing students to practical network system issues by encouraging them to build software prototypes as part of their assessments.",

The development path from its founding to the Tiananmen incident of 1989 was turbulent and far from linear. Indeed, the new China has been premised upon revolutionary remaking and a total break from the past. Nonetheless, there are still historical continuities when compared with the previous imperial and republican eras. This module aims to provide a deeper understanding of contemporary China by looking at its politics, society, economy and culture in broad historical perspective and within a thematic framework. It also explores China\u2019s distancing and connecting with the rest of the world.",

The aim of the course is to show how these methods are effectively applied, with the aid of suitable mathematical software. This module provides (i) the basic probabilistic concepts and statistical methods needed for hypothesis testing, (ii) the elements of the theory of functions of one complex variable and (iii) the analytical methods of solving systems of ordinary differential equations and of partial differential equations. The emphasis will be on applications in engineering and technology. A mathematical software such as MATLAB or Maple will be used throughout the course to demonstrate the use of software in problem solving.",

Embedded computing systems hidden inside everyday electronic devices such as hand-phones, digital cameras etc. are becoming more and more prevalent. However, the heterogeneous nature of the underlying hardware as well as tight constraints on size, cost, power, and timing pose significant challenges to embedded software development. This course presents techniques that address these distinctive characteristics of embedded software implementation. Topics include embedded software development for programmable processors and reconfigurable hardware, component-based design, optimizations for performance, power, code size, operating system issues, and case studies of available systems.",

The course develops rigorously the following concepts arising from calculus: the real number system, sequences and series of constant terms, limit and continuity of functions. The emphasis is on logical rigour. The student will be exposed to and be expected to acquire the skills to read and write mathematical proofs. Major topics: Basic properties of real numbers, supremum and infimum, completeness axiom. Sequences, limits, monotone convergence theorem, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, Cauchy's criterion for convergence. Infinite series, Cauchy's criteria, absolute and conditional convergence, tests for convergence. Limits of functions, fundamental limit theorems, one-sided limits, limits at infinity, monotone functions. Continuity of functions, intermediate-value theorem, extreme-value theorem, inverse functions.",

Students may elect to work individually (e.g. as part of an internship) or in an multidisciplinary group. Together with an external organization, and under the guidance of an academic supervisor, they apply disciplinary knowledge and skills to address an issue or question which is authentic and of practical relevance to the community. In the process, students engage communities and organizations either locally or abroad in planning, implementing and communicating their ideas and concepts, develop collaborative and leadership skills, cultural competency and an awareness of civic values. The learning experience is reflected in well-researched and thoughtful situational analyses, a learning journal, and midterm and final reports or presentations. Capstone experiences will be supervised by College faculty with expertise in the chosen area, with the participation of a qualified preceptor from the external organization.",

The emphasis is on the formulation and techniques of various cryptographic primitives, and on the secure usage of such primitives to achieve the goals of confidentially, integrity, and authenticity in both theoretical settings and practical scenarios. Basic topics include pseudorandom functions, symmetric key encryption, public key encryption, message authentication codes, hash functions, digital signatures, key exchange and PKI. Selected topics may include: secret sharing, TCP/IP security, Kerberos, SSL, trusted computing, side-channel attacks.",

MATLAB is a popular package used in engineering for simulating diverse problems while Labview is a widely adopted software in the industry for data acquisition and instrument control. Together, these two software packages will give students a good headstart in simulating and configuring practical engineering systems. The teaching of these two packages will be based on engineering fundamentals that students have learnt in the first two years. This will also help them to consolidate concepts that have been learnt in the various technical modules. Through a series of integrated miniprojects carried out in the lab, students will be guided in their exploration of engineering principles and problem solving using the tools available in Matlab and Labview.",

Through hardware hacking, circuit bending, and circuit building, students will gain an understanding of basic electronics theory as well as develop valuable hands-on experience with battery-powered sound-making and sound-processing projects. From repurposing games, toys, and radios to building oscillators, filters, mixers, and amplifiers, and finally interfacing between the physical world and computers via microcontrollers, students will explore the artistic potential of electronic circuits. An introduction to the history and current practice of electronic sound art will be integral to the module. The module will culminate in a group installation/performance. No prior experience in electronics or music is assumed, though either would be helpful.",

Construction activities inevitably introduce vibrations in the ambient environment and the sub-surface geological formations. These are usually experienced as noise and vibrations, and may also take the form of stress waves in soils and rocks which could damage foundation structures. Case studies will used to illustrate construction vibrations issues and applicable mitigation techniques. Students will also be required to undertake and complete a Group Project.

Accounts will be given to show how these ideas came about; how they have helped us to understand the mysteries of nature and how they have been developed to transform the world as we know it today. The major topics to be covered include the quantum theory of light, particle waves, wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, development of quantum mechanics, Einstein's special and general theories of relativity, the four fundamental forces, unified theory, sub-nuclear particles, fusion and fission, big-bang cosmology, evolution of stars, black holes and some modern technologies based on physics such as lasers, semiconductors and superconductors. This module is targeted at students from all years and all disciplines except physics majors.",

After brief introduction to inter-phase mass transfer, basic concepts in rate-based design for the more important separation processes such as absorption and distillation are illustrated. The rate-based design concept is then extended to operations involving simultaneous heat and mass transfer such as in cooling tower and dryer. The process design principles are illustrated with distillation, absorption, extraction, adsorption, cooling tower and drying processes.",

The module assumes a dual approach to the study of selected texts, requiring attention to the topic of violence and memory on the one hand; and the ethics and politics of representation on the other. Literary texts will illuminate problems of narrative agency, responsibility and testimony in the aftermath of a violent past. The conceptual framework of discussions derive from Maurice Blanchot and his influence on post-structuralism, and from contemporary uses of psychoanalysis by literary theorists.",

Why do we send postcards, take photographs, or collect souvenirs? Do tourists find ourselves when we go abroad? Do we lose ourselves? How are cultures packaged for tourists, and is this packaging always reductive? Such questions will help us to understand the assumptions behind tourism, and to explore issues of modernity, nationality, self and other, identity and culture.",

    "description": "This module introduces fundamental concepts of physics and is illustrated with many practical examples. Topics covered include a) Electricity and magnetism, where the basic concepts of electric and magnetic fields, forces on charged particles, electric potential, electromotive force, work and energy, are described. The properties of basic electrical circuits comprising resistors, inductors and capacitors are discussed, along with analysis of their transient and steady-state behaviour. Understanding the role of Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism is emphasized; b) Waves, introducing properties of waves, including geometric optics, propagation, interference and diffraction, and electromagnetic waves; and c) Quantum physics, where new physics concepts which led to the quantization of energy are introduced, leading to an explanation of atomic transitions, atomic spectra and the physical and the chemical properties of the atom. The uncertainty principle, wave-mechanics and wave particle duality concepts are covered, together with the use of wavefunctions in predicting the behaviour of trapped particles. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.",

Practical sessions will cover analytical methods for determination of some food components and enzyme activity, kinetics, and inhibitions in the context of foods.",

In the process of developing these tools, we will discuss the determinants of consumption and investment. Next we turn to different business cycle theories. Specifically, we study the Keynesian, New Keynesian, Neo Classical and Real Business Cycle models, and examine their different assumptions and policy prescriptions for macroeconomic stabilization. IS-LM and AD-AS frameworks are employed in studying some or all of these paradigms. Finally, we evaluate the predictions of these models against business cycle facts. We will also briefly review national income accounting and discuss some measurement issues.",

Natural as well as human-induced changes are considered. Thus, the module provides a basic examination of natural processes which operate at or near Earth's surface covering the biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and pedosphere. It also explores critical issues in space and society: flows of capital, culture and people as well as place identity. The module is designed as an introductory module for first year Geography students, as well as a general module for cross faculty students hoping to understand the foundations of the discipline.",

The term bioorthogonal chemistry refers to some of these chemical reactions that can occur inside living systems without interfering with native biochemical processes. Since its introduction, the concept of the bioorthogonal reaction has enabled the study of many types of biomolecules under native cellular environments. In recent years, it has been expanded to many other fields, materials, nanotechnology and engineering. This seminar is intended for junior undergraduates who are interested in equipping themselves with a few very basic but essential set of organic reactions which are most relevant to non-specialists. The module will be conducted in the form of seminar discussion and presentations in a highly interactive manner. Both students and the professor will learn hand-in-hand about the subject of interest, and the students will be required to participate actively in twoway discussion. By using key examples in bioorthogonal chemistry developed in the last decade, the students will focus on interactive learning in unconventional ways (reading, literature search, group discussion, independent studies, presentation, etc). The professor will mostly serve as the facilitator (not feeder) of the learning process.",

As part of the phonetic bases for phonological patterns, we study the speech organs, the description and classification of speech sounds, and other aspects of articulatory phonetics relevant for phonological patterns.",

    "description": "One of the main problems of consciousness concerns whether consciousness can be explained solely in terms of brain activity and the like. Some philosophers think so. After all, science has successfully explained various cognitive functions in such terms, and it\u2019s natural to think that its success will eventually extend to consciousness. Other philosophers disagree, finding it hard to fathom how consciousness can arise from the purely physical. To help us decide which answer is correct, we shall examine various important positions on the nature of consciousness including physicalism, dualism, eliminativism, and idealism.",

Particulate solids are characterized in terms of size, size distribution, measurement and analysis and processing such as comminution and mixing. The concept of fluid flow and particle settling in fluids are used for design and operation of some important fluid-particle separation methods. The principle of fluidization and its applications in bio-reactors and pneumatic transport of solids are also included. It also covers crystallization, which is used as a tool for bio-separation.",

    "description": "The essence of nanoworld, i.e. nanoscience and technology, is the ability to understand and manipulate matter at the atomic level. Structures and electronic and magnetic structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). They exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. To understand the nanoworld, we will introduce basic and advance spectroscopy and scattering synchrotron-based techniques such as x-ray absorption, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, resonant soft x-ray scattering, xray photoemission spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. We will also introduce scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed include: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement techniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects and devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating nanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the future? This module is targeted at students from different faculties who are interested in learning some general knowledge of nanoscience and nanotechnology.",

It will emphasise that laws alone will not help in ensuring the quality of a country\u2019s environment and the health of its citizens. Laws must be enforced, and the rule of law respected. Good governance is therefore a necessary component of sound environmental management. This module will next examine what constitutes good environmental governance. It will explore environmental and economic policies and how best to resolve the tensions between conservation and development. It will study the setting up of effective administrative institutions, land use planning, the provision of environmental infrastructure (modern sanitation, water treatment plants, transport systems, etc). It will then critically examine the workings of the main administrative agencies that are responsible for environmental management in Singapore. It will also look into the work of local and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as multi-national corporations and corporate social responsibility in Singapore. Comparisons will be made with the administrative and legal systems in other jurisdictions. This module will be taught by staff members from the Law Faculty as well as the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.",

The scientific process of enquiry is therefore governed by basic and general yet essential principles. Abide by these principles, we will likely do good science (even though the findings may not be what we have expected, if not wanted, it to be). Ignore these principles we will be on a slippery slope to bad science. Violate these principles we will end up with ugly science. Students will learn about essential principles of scientific enquiry and why they are important in the acquisition of knowledge, and when they are ignored or violated, it will lead to bad and ugly consequences as had occurred in the real world. Students will learn what is meant by scientific, pseudoscientific, unscientific and non-scientific ideas. Student will learn to appreciate the strengths (and limitation) of scientific scholarship as well as respect nonscientific scholarship. Finally, students will learn that the scientific approach when intersect with non-scientific disciplines (such as ethics, legal) can prevent science from turning ugly and when combine with creativity and imagination can produce beautiful results with powerful impact.",

Analogy is an important factor in preparing, if not predicting, new concepts while an experience-based intuition can sometimes be an obstacle. The objective of this seminar module is to present case studies of the creative role of analogy in mathematics and of the ground-breaking importance of \"counter-intuition\" in modern mathematics. A wealth of examples of both can be found in geometry, number theory, analysis, algebra, logic, set theory and theoretical computer science. Students of this module are expected to source for relevant material in books, journals and the internet under the guidance of the lecturer. The emphasis, however, will be on the spirit of the mathematical enterprise rather than on the technical mastery. To illustrate the use of analogy and intuition in problem solving, some elementary problems and puzzles will be posed in class for attempt and discussion. The main prerequisite for this module is an inquiring mind open to new ideas.

The course will start with an appreciation of the immense biodiversity of plants in our region. The irreplaceable values that natural primary forests have will be emphasized. The case of the need to extend these forests by recreating them in the urban context will be discussed. The appropriate use of non-indigenous plants will also be covered. The need to be ecological-minded when selecting plants will be emphasized with particular attention being placed on conservation; the beautification of place should not be done at the expense of making another landscape look less attractive. Lectures will be augmented with field trips which serve illustrate the application of the principles discussed to the ground. The business implications to matching the right plant to site, using quality plants and then being able to care for them professionally will be covered.",

Understanding gender provides a foundation to analyze social structures (power and inequality), social institutions (family, kinship, education, economy, the state, health) and cultural issues (science, food, emotions, popular culture).",

In the second part of the module, the students have to design a working electroplating set-up (high efficiency, uniform temperature stability and optimum pH bath solution) and study several parameters that influence the quality of the plated film quality. They will look into the morphology, structural characteristics using optical microscopy and XRD analysis. The electrical characteristics will be evaluated through I-V characterization of the Ni plated films.",

The primary focus is the underlying game logic, like game physics, artificial intelligence and world simulation (and not presentation components like graphics or sound). Brief overview and introduction lectures will be followed by small group projects. Each student will participate in three different projects of four weeks. Students will need to come up with ideas and designs of interesting subsystems, reason about the integration into a game, and implement a prototype. Example projects are explosion physics, herd animal behaviour, and thunderstorm simulation.",

The module looks at both decolonisation and nation-building as processes characterised by debate and contestation in relation to (a) social, regional and group identity and (b) political rights and power. The module will study the impact of that debate and contestation on the character, institutions and political life of the nation.",

It combines weekly lectures on the basic types of historical scholarship with tutorials containing a seminar-style lab component that train students in the core skills of research, reading and writing. Tutorial and lab sessions will consist of a series of specially designed hands-on assignments, intensive discussion and close supervision. By the end of the module, students will be able to effectively read historical scholarship and sources, and to conceptualize, research, and complete a simple history project on their own.",

    "description": "This course takes a multi-disciplinary, practitionerdriven perspective to analysing government policies and actions. It does this by applying three conceptual paradigms to studying government, namely standard economics, behavioural economics and organisational psychology. The course will first examine governments through the lens of market failures and how economists have viewed the role of government. It will then examine the cognitive limits of economic agents and explore how behavioural economics offers the prospect of better policy design. In the third segment, the course explores government actions through the lens of organisational psychology, and examines how bureaucratic inertia impedes reform and innovation.",

    "description": "This course aims to provide students with an introduction to irony, a central term in literary and cultural studies. Irony presupposes disjunctions \u2013 between what is said and what is meant, what is perceived and what is real. It thus involves a critical attitude in exploiting and/or perceiving disjunctions. It is often directed with negative effect towards figures and structures of authority, and is sometimes an integral part of a world-view. Students will engage closely with a variety of texts of different types, including poems, tracts, short stories, speeches, plays, sketches, songs and pictures. In doing so, they will reach a better understanding of the roles irony can play not only in literature, but also in society more generally. Since the texts are drawn from different historical times, media and geographical locations, students will get a sense of the widespread use of irony in culture and society.",

Although such a study could take place within any national context, this module will focus on Singapore as a location for taking up this issue.

Sometimes known as \u2018computing-in-the-wild\u2019, this change poses a challenge for existing desktop-oriented evaluation methodologies and design practices. Students in this course will explore the theory and practice of such relevant concepts as situatedness, context, and mobile media in the context of designing for these distributed environments. At the end of this course, students will be able to participate in the research agenda of designing for situated interaction.",

The theoretical component will also conduct a broad survey of the influential theories of theatre &amp; performance from the 20th century to the present, assessing their impact on contemporary global performance practices. Through the practical sessions, students will experience hands-on the various aspects of a stage production, from acting, directing to design and stage management.",

The lectures and discussion groups provide an introduction to clinical intervention, but emphasis is placed on the theoretical formulation of problems. Whenever possible, films and case studies are used to supplement the textbook and readings, and a visit to the local Institute of Mental Health will usually be arranged.",

The course is intended primarily for students doing a single major in Psychology, and is designed as an introduction to those wishing to pursue advanced courses in Cognitive Neuroscience (PL3285 &amp; PL4206). The course will focus on key questions asked about the brain, such as: How is the brain organised? How do drugs affect our behaviour? How does the brain see, hear and produce movement? How does it learn and think? Clinical topics, such as Parkinson's Disease and schizophrenia will be integrated into the course, as will fMRI research methods and findings. Emphasis will be given to the key principles of nervous system function, however, the course still requires a lot of factual information to be assimilated and memorized.",

Therefore, it is critical that real estate professionals understand the complexity and dynamics of issues affecting the behaviour of real estate players during the different stages of the real estate development cycle. This multidisciplinary module looks at the different principles, concepts and methodology of behavioural studies in real estate. The first half of the module addresses salient principles and concepts of sensation, attention, learning, memory and attitude. This is followed by methodological perspectives of behavioural studies in real estate. With interactive lectures, on-site learning and workshop, students will have the opportunity to have first hand perspective of real issues affecting behaviour of real estate players.",

    "description": "This module explores the complex relationship between Hollywood and Asia, looking at how these pop culture industries influence and shape one another. Many observers have pointed to Hollywood\u2019s decline in recent decades. Meanwhile, Asian cinemas are on the rise, offering local moviegoers alternatives to the Hollywood blockbusters that have dominated theaters across the globe for decades. Hollywood has become an export-driven industry, and Asia provides its most important overseas market. In this small seminar, students will discuss topics such as the most recent kung fu movie craze, Hollywood remakes of Asian films, and cross-cultural fandom. We'll analyze films such as Infernal Affairs, Slumdog Millionaire, and Rush Hour 2. Studying both popular media coverage and academic essays, students will learn how authors construct arguments around a particular topic, how these discourses respond to one another, and how they themselves can construct their own responses to a topic.",

In this expository writing module, we examine the social, political, and economic roots of divergent responses to press freedom and the likely impacts of restricting/restricting press freedom in democratic societies. Students will read key texts in the field supplemented with films and other materials, and will develop skills in comprehensible and cohesive writing, critical reasoning, rhetorical persuasion, and intellectually rigorous argumentation. Students proceed through progressively more challenging tasks, beginning with pr&#233;cis writing, to arguing a policy position, and culminating in a research paper.",

This is followed by an initiation into the concepts of classical probability, paving the way for the important topics of random variables and probability distributions. Next, the core ideas of classical statistical inference are introduced - including sampling distributions, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing and analysis of variance. Finally, correlation and regression analyses will be covered.",

Science has caused paradigm shifts in artistic expression and art is used for engineering design and communication of scientific knowledge. In this module, students will be introduced to: (1) The use of materials and technology related to architecture, sculpture, painting, photography, imaging, etc\u2026 (2) The use of color, light, and perspective to create a 3-dimensional illusion. (3) The use of technology for dating and attribution of objects of art. (4) The use of visual art for scientific illustration and design. Knowledge of the scientific principles of various forms of visual art will be explored. The module also aims at the development of some artistic skills for illustrations of scientific concepts and engineering designs.",

This course will introduce students to: (1) Various phenomena/features related to the oceans, such as tsunamis, thermohalines, tides, currents, storms, marine life and bioluminescence etc.. (2) How the oceans affect our lives (e.g. weather, climate, sources of food, travel etc) , (3) Our attempts at understanding the workings of the oceans using exploration and the scientific theories that have been developed over the last few decades. (4) Our attempts at controlling and exploiting the oceans (e.g. conservation, energy, marine engineering). Students will gain an appreciation of the scientific principles involved with the minimum of mathematics. This course will also prepare studnets to better understand the role of oceans, and provide insight into making educated decisions regarding our vulnerable environment and our precious supply of water.",

Through lectures, reading and listening assignments, and actually playing different styles of music, students will learn how music works, why people listen to and make music, what its roles are in a society, and how these things vary in different cultures. The module introduces a variety of musical styles and cultures that represent an enormous wealth of human experience. At the end of the course the students will have access to a much wider variety of music to listen to, participate in, enjoy, and understand.",

And what can it tell us about both the distinctiveness of the theatre experience, and the place and times we live in? To answer these questions, this module, which requires no prior knowledge of theatre, starts with the spectator\u2019s experience and works outwards. Part one identifies theatre\u2019s unique qualities, part two explores how to analyse them, and part three considers theatricality in mass culture. Lectures and tutorial discussions will draw on plays, critical writings and one (partly subsidized) trip to the theatre.",

Gradually, short selection from media and literature sources such as short stories, poems, announcements, reports and other short, topic-specific pieces will be introduced to begin to familiarize students with actual usage while not overwhelming them with new vocabulary and grammatical forms.",

In this module, students will read, analyse, and discuss texts from literature, non-fiction, and academic sources covering a wide range of subjects related to the culture and society of the target language. Selection will include text and passage from short stories, journals, magazines, and newspapers, as well as audio-visual materials such as TV programs, feature films, etc. The range of readings is intended, firstly, to broaden students' vocabulary and familiarize them with terms relating to many fields of endeavor. Secondly, the objective is to introduce students to various aspects of the society and culture as expressed by Indonesian writers. Through exposure to the language as it appears in books and in the media, students will be able to hone their own language skills to be more applicable and practical in a workplace, academic, or business setting.",

    "description": "Process Analysis and Redesign is a systematic approach to helping an organization analyze and improve its processes. In this course the term \u2018redesign\u2019 includes \u2018reengineering\u2019. All systems are designed and developed to support business processes. Therefore, an understanding of the business processes is crucial to choosing how to build and manage systems, re-skill personnel and retool the infrastructure. A business process is a collection of activities that creates an output that is of value to some customer. Business processes can be improved at any level of an organization or can be improved across multiple organizations. Typically, Business Process Redesign/Reengineering (BPR) uses information technology to enable business process change in order to reduce costs, improve service, and reduce cycle times. Several BPR methodologies exist. Most methodologies require the construction of an \u201cAs-Is\u201d and \u201cTo-Be\u201d model. This course will discuss the role of BPR in managing technology and the operational functions. The course will cover the strategic, operational and technological dimensions of BPR in the context of quality improvement, Information Technology and business operations. Case studies will provide real-world context for the concepts discussed in class. The course is designed to teach students BPR methodologies and modeling techniques that accompany the methodology. Students will identify an organization (or part of an organization) that needs improvement. Next, they will analyze the current system, investigate possible Information Technology and operational solutions, redesign the current system and propose a plan to move from the \u201cAs-Is\u201d system to the \u201cTo-Be\u201d system.",

Besides presenting the classic major sociological theories of education, an array of case studies that elaborate on extra-curriculum education will also be presented. We will examine the relationship between education and nation building, the impact of schooling on social stratification, the functions and effects of education, the teaching of discipline through extra-curriculum educational activities, and the relationship between the educational system and the workplace. This course is mounted for all students with interest in the sociology of education.",

Topics that are also introduced are actuators for achieving motion, primarily various types of electric motors. This course also covers the generalised measurement and instrumentation system, the associated electronics, drivers and power supplies for the processing of the signals from the sensors and transducers and for driving the various actuators. Emphasis is placed on the knowledge required for the application of these sensors and actuators rather than on their design.",

    "description": "The history of Singapore has traditionally been conceived along internal lines, based mainly, if not solely, on the traditional trajectories of administrative, political and national historical narratives. Yet, as we all know, the evolution of Singapore, from classical regional emporium to international port city and strategic naval base, has all along been defined by much larger regional and international forces. After its emergence as a sovereign state in 1965, Singapore continues to project itself as a 'global city-state'. Our local society has an 'international' make-up, being the product as it were of historical and current diasporic trends. This module provides an international framework for a study of the history of Singapore, and seeks to examine the historical evolution of Singapore against the contexts of regional and international changes and developments from the 14th to the 20th century. This module is open to all students throughout NUS interested in Singapore history/studies.",

In particular it will examine bilateral collaboration in infrastructure development (ports and telecommunications) and services (airline and tourism) industries to explain the success and problems of bilateral economic collaboration. The target audiences are students from various Faculties who would like to have a better understanding of Singapore's evolving foreign economic policy in South Asia in an increasingly globalised economy.",

In addition, we consider: the structure of financial markets for different instruments, the range of instruments traded therein, and the mechanisms facilitating trade in financial assets, and an assessment of the structure and efficiency of these markets in Singapore vis-? -vis similar markets in other industrialized economies. To assess issues of efficiency and market structure, the course will include frequent references to markets in other economies, including the US, Australia, the UK, Hong Kong as well as other emerging market economics.",

Very often misleading claims in science and in society more generally can arise from an ignorance of basic statistical ideas, but statistical methods can also be abused knowingly in fraudulent behaviour. On the other hand, statistical methods are also commonly used to detect and uncover fraud and dishonesty. After first looking at different kinds of deception involving data and the motivations for it this seminar will discuss the role of statistics in uncovering deception in areas such as: 1. Misleading claims in health; 2. Misleading surveys and opinion polls; 3. Claims and counterclaims in environmental science; 4. Fraud detection in the financial world; 5. Authorship disputes and detecting plagiarism It is intended that students gain an appreciation for basic statistical ideas for handling uncertainty as a key part of good scientific practice and decision making in society broadly.",

We will discuss the nature of waves by starting with the idea that a wave is simply a disturbance that propagates in a medium via the interaction of its parts. Using the above and other phenomena, we examine what we can learn about matter from the various kinds of waves. We will also trace the important steps in scientific thinking that has taken the idea of a wave from a mere description of empirical observations to the abstract but powerfully predictive concept of a quantum wave.",

The module encourages students to think beyond the conventions of cinema studies (national cinema, genre, etc), the rationale being that as screen culture spreads beyond industrial cinema, so too should theory and criticism. Films studied will privilege independent and experimental work, video/media art, animation and web-based video, emphasising the diversification of moving image practices with video and digital media.",

Topics covered include the Lucas, Sargent-Wallace and Fischer (overlapping wage contract) models, as well as the Shapiro-Stiglitz efficiency wage model and Romer's menu cost - coordination failure model. In the second section, various inter-temporal optimization models are analysed, and their salient economic lessons discussed. Topics covered include a two-period model, overlapping-generations models with certain and uncertain lifetimes, Hall's life-cycle-permanent-income model, as well as optimal control models of investment behaviour and endogenous growth. A lecture on some principal macroeconomic features of the Singapore Economy concludes the course.",

After a discussion of the various versions of Bernoulli's equation and the concept of vorticity, the study of fluid flows starts with the potential flows, with an application to the theory of airfoils. The theory of irrotational water waves is then presented to illustrate dispersive wave propagation and the hyperbolic tendency to form shocks. The balance of these two tendencies produces soliton solutions. The concept of flow similarity is applied to the study of boundary layer. The phenomenon of boundary layer separation is discussed. The concept of hydrodynamic instability is illustrated with the Rayleigh-Benard convection problem. The chaotic dynamics of the related Lorenz equation is then presented. A brief introduction to turbulence closes the module.",

This module introduces students to the fundamental concepts of statistical inference such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, as well as to statistical tools useful in business analysis, such as regression analysis and time series analysis.",

    "description": "All manufacturing and service organisations have an operations function that is primarily responsible for the production and delivery of their products and services. The operations function therefore not only affects final product quality but also impacts customer service and the overall competitiveness of the organisation. The objective of this course is to introduce and highlight the strategic importance of operations, and the fundamental principles and concepts of effective operations management. Students will examine how operations decisions in areas such as quality, process design, capacity and inventory can be managed, controlled and improved. Operations in both manufacturing and service organisations will be addressed.(Although no prerequisite is stated, this module assumes prior knowledge of basic probability concepts like expected value, variance, normal distribution, and Poisson distribution. Students should ensure that they are adequately prepared for this module.)",

    "description": "This module provides a broad survey of Chinese business development in Singapore from the pre-modern era (pre 1819) through to current times. It traces the evolution of the Chinese business community and examines the growth and expansion of their networks in East and Southeast Asia. It also examines the roles played by colonial authorities and the 'China connection' in the development of these business networks. Specific case studies are drawn on to allow a closer understanding of the way Chinese businesses were established and how they developed. The social, economic and cultural aspects closely associated with the Chinese business community of Singapore, such as early Chinese migration, dialect organisations, guilds, occupational structure, Chinese merchant culture, as well as the transformation and globalisation of Chinese businesses will also be discussed. This module is open to all students in NUS interested in Singapore history/studies.",

Students practise the analysis and interpretation of arts and become familiar with the major shifts of the arts in the 20th century and the basics of postmodern aesthetics. During the production of creative works, the focus lies on the training of conceptual skills. Similarities between artistic and strategic creativity are investigated. The connection between art and leadership, the tradition of the avant-garde and a discussion about favourable conditions for innovation in a society serve to round up the module.",

    "description": "Environmental protection is now fundamental to the development of a sustainable global society. No longer is human influence on the planet confined to the local environment, but now extends across political boundaries - often resulting in regional or even global impacts. As a result, society, industry and agriculture are under increasing pressure to improve environmental performance and cut resource consumption and pollution. Around the world, governments are striving to minimise waste production, protect water resources, reduce energy consumption and improve the quality of the urban living environment. As the human global population grows exponentially and the life-support systems of the planet continue to deteriorate, there is a growing international recognition that environmental problems require truly global solutions. This course will focus on the issues and causes of global environmental issues including: population growth, resource exploitation and threats to the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. The aim of the course will be to provide students with a knowledge and appreciation of the inter-related problems and challenges of sustainable development.",

    "description": "Nanoparticles may be defined as colloids about 1-100 nanometers in size and are considered a cornerstone of the emerging discipline of nanoscience and nanotechnology. At such small length scales, nanoparticles often exhibit unusual properties that differ from their bulk counterparts. For example, a semiconductor nanoparticle of the same material can emit all colors of the rainbow as its size is varied from 1 to 7 nanometers in diameter while nanoparticles of gold no longer glitter but look red under room light. These properties are only beginning to be exploited for use in the medical, electronic and chemical industry and will undoubtedly have a great impact on next-generation technologies. Through this seminar module, students will be introduced to different nanoparticles and their physicochemical properties from a chemist\u2019s perspective. They will also be introduced to the latest discoveries in nanoparticle research that are being translated rapidly into commercially available technologies.",

Through a variety of texts including plays, television programmes and films, the module teaches how the production and circulation of popular forms can be read as performance: how they are produced or packaged for consumption, how the consumer relates to them and how their success or failure is measured. It will show the pervasiveness and relevance of performativity in everyday societal interactions and the hybirdization of Asian and Euro-American cultures.",

The impact of the Southeast Asia performance on the Western avant-garde theatre will be studied. Key subsidiary issues such as authenticity, cultural appropriation will be considered as well. Independent study of primary material is required. Students of theatre studies, sociology, and history may find this module useful.",

It covers basic concepts in research design, instrumentation, data collection, and data analysis. Related topics on validity, reliability, and ethical issues in conducting research are also covered. While the main focus remains on the research methods, this module also introduces basic concepts of statistics such as descriptive statistics, sampling distribution, hypothesis testing. Basic levels of parametric and non parametric statistics are also introduced. A set of computer lab assignments will give students extensive opportunity to become familiar with the SPSS computer software package and experience at computing the various statistics reviewed in the class.",

The module starts with the drug discovery process and natural products research. Growth and product kinetics are reviewed through a cursory treatment. This is followed by introduction to rDNA and hybridoma technology for biopharmaceuticals production. Detailed treatment of fermenter design including operating strategies, and transport phenomena with respect to agitation and aeration follows. Considerations for mammalian cell cultivation are discussed as well as media sterilization and process monitoring of a bioprocess. These concepts are finally applied to a lab project. This module is targeted at graduate students who are interested in biopharmaceuticals production.",

This module builds on the concepts learnt in EE2011 Engineering Electromagnetism and EE2023 Signals and Systems. Students will start the experiments with the Frequency Modulation (FM) technique in conjunction with a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). This is followed by experiments with FM demodulation techniques, simplex communication and duplex communication. Then students will learn about the reflection coefficient and plot it in the Smith Chart. Subsequently an antenna is designed and the building blocks of the communication system are characterized. Finally the complete communication system is assembled and measured.",

The intermingling of people, the exchange of ideas and international commerce have been part of Southeast Asian life for centuries. This module surveys the broad currents of conflict, change and continuity across the region from a multidisciplinary perspective. It looks at how Southeast Asian societies and political systems have changed over time in response to the pressures of ecology, colonialism, nationalism, urbanization and globalization. The module also looks at the way ethnic, religious, national and regional identities have been constructed, used and altered over time. The overall objective is to provide students with an introduction to different ways of exploring Southeast Asia and different experiences of living in the region.",

Since the operation of an economy cannot be devoid of its institutional context, special attention will be paid to the political economy of development. Besides the economics literature, we will also read selected works by historians, political scientists, and sociologists to gain a more comprehensive understanding of development issues in Asia, Africa, and the West in recent centuries.",

Plato, for example, wrote that \u2018when the mode of music changes, the walls of the city tremble\u2019, and Confucians and Legalists engaged in extended controversy over the social desirability of music. Students will be asked to read theoretical writings on music and politics by these and other thinkers (including Rousseau, Nietzsche, and Adorno) and to consider how music has been exploited at the level of political practice for a wide variety of purposes from promoting nationalism to articulating popular protest.",

Topics to be covered include the nature of control, responsibility centers, economic value added, transfer pricing, strategic planning, budgeting, performance evaluation systems, executive compensation, control for differentiated strategies, control for multinational organisations. Students learn how control is exercised through case analyses, case presentations and in-class discussions. The case approach makes control &quot;come alive&quot; for the students with descriptions of control at various real organisations. The case presentations make the students think critically and strategically. The in-class discussions allow the students to evaluate the pros and cons of different approaches and solutions to control problems.",

Through a close reading of various texts, seminar participants will explore the relationality between sight and blindness\u2014are they necessarily antonyms, or are they always already a part of each other? And if they are intimately related, what are the implications on knowledge? Are we all potentially blind to our own insights?",

It aims to explore the critical issues and implications of intercultural theatre, a term largely used by Western critics, from specifically Asian positions of practice, and to assess interculturalism as an approach against other concepts such as adaptation. To these ends, it will take Shakespeare as a site of intercultural exchange, and compare a number of Asian productions of Shakespeare plays with a European one. The module is aimed at students majoring in Theatre Studies.",

It also deals with the determination of exchange rates, the operation of monetary and fiscal policy under different exchange rate regimes, and, more broadly, international trends that may influence the overall direction of the world in the next few years.",

Advanced Surfacing covers principles and methods to craft high precision, manufacturing-quality CAD models with complex, continuous organic surfaces that are water-tight. Parametric & Generative CAD teaches programming and algorithm-scripting-based methods to digitally generate and control 3D geometry. Digital Manufacturing introduces methods to translate 3D data to produce physical objects via digital manufacturing equipment. Students are expected to gain an operationally-ready level of mastery through hands-on experimentation in projects for all three areas.",

The most well-known aspect of information retrieval is document retrieval: the process of indexing and retrieving text documents. However, the field of information retrieval includes almost any type of unstructured or semi-structured data, including newswire stories, transcribed speech, email, blogs, images, or video. Therefore, information retrieval is a critical aspect of Web search engines. This module also serves as the foundation for subsequent modules on the understanding, processing and retrieval of particular web media.",

Students will form several groups to search information on the major plant pathogens in human history and learn about the factors that influence plant pathogens to attack plants. Students will also learn how to recognize symptoms caused by various plant pathogens and methods of plant disease investigation. There will be discussions on plant disease detection and diagnosis, plant pathogen-host interactions and development of disease resistant plants using transgenic techniques. Students will explore the origins of plant pathogens and their evolution, agricultural crops as food, transgenic crops and food safety issues related to plant diseases. This freshmen seminar is suitable for both life science and nonlife science majors.",

Successive lectures investigate alternative conceptions of the human condition, such as ones in which we are unfree, or non-spirituous, or inhabit a world whose fundamental nature is hidden from our view. Different conceptions bear differently on the further question of what we should value and why. Discussion is both argument-driven and historically informed.",

The module looks at both decolonisation and nation-building as processes characterised by debate and contestation in relation to (a) social, regional and group identity and (b) political rights and power. The module will study the impact of that debate and contestation on the character, institutions and political life of the nation.",

The students will conduct independent reading, research, discussion, and/or writing under the direction of the faculty member. The course grade is usually based on a written report and two seminars covering the research. The teaching objective of the module is for faculty members with expertise in relevant fields of chemical research to impart knowledge on, provide guidance to and stimulate creative thinking of students with interest in modern chemistry. The students are expected to gain in-depth understanding of the chosen topic through discussions/meetings with the faculty members, his/her own research work, and preparation and presentation of written/oral reports. Each student is assigned at least one adviser from the faculty. The student should meet with his/her adviser at the beginning of the semester. The adviser and student will select a topic for investigation within the advisers area of expertise. For example, the assignment might require the students to read some recent journal articles or chapters in selected books. During subsequent meetings, the student and adviser will discuss the material and related issues. The student will then prepare a brief written report summarizing the background and significance of the problem under consideration, the approaches used to solve the problem, and the results of the investigations reported in the articles or books. The written report is due at the end of the semester. The student will also be required to make two oral presentations (one around the middle of the semester, and another one at the end of the semester) to show his or her understanding of the problem, and what he or she has read.",

First, an important goal of the module is to clarify the extent to which mental and physical health/illness have been socially constructed and unevenly distributed in society. The module further identifies the effects of such social conditions as socioeconomic status, education, gender, and social networks on patterns of health inequality. Finally, it delves into specific issues like social epidemiology, stress process, and health care where possible causal relationships between a variety of social forces and health/illness are explored.",

But they often draw upon official documents that are sometimes bland statements of fact, eyewitness accounts that vary greatly, or the seemingly hidden world of text and social media.

    "description": "The essence of nanoscience and technology is the ability to understand and manipulate matter at the molecular level. Structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). Such structures exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed include: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement techniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects and devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating nanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the future? This module is targeted at students from different faculties who are interested in learning some general knowledge of nanoscience and nanotechnology.",

In this course, students will be exposed to computational thinking methods such as the use of abstraction, compositionality, divide and conquer, caching, reduction, invariants, randomness, and parallelism. Students will do case studies to compare and contrast computational thinking with thinking methods used to organize non-computing domains. Small group teaching with emphasis on discovery and insights as well as communication skills will be used.

It introduces logic as a means for specifying, verifying and reasoning about computer programs. It emphasises, in contrast to other similar logic courses, on how logic can be used to represent computational problems, how these representations can be proven correct and how they can be executed on a computer. Topics covered include classical logic theories, logic programming, modal logic, and an introduction to non-standard logics. Treatments of predicate calculus and temporal logic are fully covered with emphasis on their specification, verification, deductive and algorithmic aspects.",

Uncertainty, variability and incomplete information are inherent; to a greater or lesser extend, in all disciplines. One approach to dealing with this is through statistical and probabilistic ideas about information. The student will, throughout the module, gain an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of such a data based approach and learn how and when such an approach is appropriate. The student will also learn practical skills in interpreting statistical information and gain the ability to critically evaluate statistically based arguments.",

This module examines these questions through the use of tools of microeconomic analysis and analyzes the behavior of consumers, producers and insurers in the healthcare market. The issue of how healthcare is financed will be examined from the perspective of economic efficiency and equity. The course will also relate the theories developed to current policy issues.",

Students will also be exposed to some of the important methods of analysis - such as case studies, formal modeling, and statistical analysis - that help distinguish the current study of international relations from that of previous eras. Important approaches, such as constructivism and rational choice, will also be discussed.

It aims to provide students with general understanding of the core areas of HRM, including HR planning, job analysis, recruitment and selection, performance management, training and development, compensation, employee relations, and HRM in an international context. These issues will all be addressed from the perspective of general managers, HRM specialists, and individual employees. Students will be challenged to consider the implications of integrated HR systems, as well as specific HRM policies and implementation procedures, for individual and organisational performance. They will also consider the practical implications of the changing nature of work and the employment relationship.",

The first step on this quest begins with understanding the fundamental principles underlying the molecular and cellular functions of neuronal and glial cells, the building blocks of the brain. This module seeks (1) to inform; (2) to challenge on the basis that scientific enquiry is uncertain while knowledge is tentative and (3) to relate neurobiology to our lives. The topics include: (1) Neuronal signalling; (2) Mechanisms of neurotransmission; (3) Neuronal growth, regeneration and degeneration and (4) Glial function and neurogrowth factors.",

The nature of physical law imposes unique constraints on the evolution and functioning of living organisms \u2013 the same constraints (and opportunities) we encounter when inventing technologies. This module will investigate how living organisms of all shapes and sizes have evolved creative solutions around natural constraints, and indeed turned these into opportunities for amazing feats of \u2018natural\u2019 engineering. To do this, students will learn important engineering fundamentals such as fluid mechanics and chemical and heat transport. The overall goals are to assemble a conceptual toolkit to analyse physical and chemical technologies, and to also highlight how nature can inspire new man-made technologies.",

The emphasis is on the role of chemical and engineering science in materials processing. The module commences with an introduction to basic concepts in the kinetic theory of gases, thin film formation, vacuum technology and surface preparation. The next section covers a variety of thin film deposition techniques \u2013 physical as well as chemical. Thin film processing and patterning is the next subject of discussion. In particular, process operations relevant to semi-conductor device manufacture are covered. Diagnostics and characterisation of thin films is also presented with a view to familiarise students in state-of-the-art methodologies. The last part is devoted to an intensive study of thin film phenomena from a materials perspective. This module is targeted at level 4 chemical engineering students.",

Students will appreciate the concepts of models and model structures, the ways to obtain them and their applications. Two modeling approaches will be covered; physical modeling which includes the principles and phases ofmodeling using basic physical relationships, and identification approaches covering both non-parametric and parametric identification. Practical issues in modeling, including instrument calibration, model structure selection, data collection configuration, selection of test signals and model validation will also be duly covered. Via project work, students will consolidate the topics covered in class with hands-on experience in modeling, simulating and controlling real systems. They will be equipped with useful practical skills at the end of this course.",

The course will begin with a brief exploration of the bases of cognition, including the topics of neurophysiology, sensation and perception, and cognitive science/psychology. Using this as a basis, the course will go on to explore biases in decision making, the role of emotion in cognition and cognitive styles, persuasion and influence, conformity and obedience, sensemaking and cognition in high-stress/high-reliability environments, cognition in groups and teams, ethical decision-making, and the importance of understanding what makes us happy... the latter of which is often difficult for us to predict and has implications for our (inevitable) lives as employees in organizations. Throughout the course an attempt will be made to understand the way students think, the biases they hold when making decisions and interpreting environmental stimuli in the context of organisations, and the ways in which their emotions influence their decisions and judgments. Also highlighted will be the usefulness of introspection and an awareness of their own thought processes and assumptions... an aim that almost all religions and many academic pursuits attempt forward, yet one which is often excluded from the study of business to the detriment of business people.",

The design equations for ideal reactors are then introduced followed by the general methods of analysis of rate data. Reactor sequencing, yield versus productivity in multiple reactions, and non-isothermal operations round up the first half of the course. More advanced topics such as coupling of reactions with transport processes, non-ideal flow behaviour in reactors, and reaction dynamics and stability, form the bulk of the second half of the course.",

Six types of energy will be dealt with, concerning (1) the transformation of light energy to chemical energy by plants, (2) the transformation of chemical energy to chemical potential energy of ions and water across bio-membranes, (3) the transformation of chemical potential energy to electrical energy by plasmalemma with special emphasis on neurons, (4) the transformation of chemical energy to mechanical energy by muscle, and (5) the production and release of heat during energy transformation. Since neurons and muscle tissues require a relatively constant extracellular environment for them to function properly, the important concept of homeostasis will be discussed. Emphasis will be on extracellular fluid volume and composition. In addition, mechanisms involved in the balance of heat gain and heat loss to maintain a constant body temperature will be covered.",

    "description": "Required for voice majors during the first 4 semesters of enrollment, these modules allow students to learn about music through participation in a vocal performance ensemble. Choral music is a vibrant and vital part of many traditions and cultures world wide and has played a major role in western music throughout history. Students will participate in regular rehearsals, and will learn and perform choral music from the Renaissance to the Twentieth-century. Through these courses, students will gain knowledge of diverse repertoire, composers, genres, styles, and period performance practices. Students will also learn fundamentals of vocal production and choral technique and will experience working together in a unique team ensemble.",

Aggregate Supply functions under differing assumptions regarding labour-market clearing and price expectations (rational or adaptive) are derived next, and combined with the Aggregate Demand function to study policy and other effects. We next examine the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, and simple inflation-unemployment dynamics. We also study further policy issues (time inconsistency, Ricardian Equivalence, profit-sharing), open-economy macroeconomics (the Mundell-Fleming model), and simple growth theory (the Solow model and the AK endogenous growth model).",

    "description": "This module is a continuation of the foundation module on microeconomics. It is designed to equip students with the standard tools and techniques to analyze microeconomic issues and to prepare them to access higher level modules that utilize microeconomic analysis. The module begins with a review of several foundation topics on consumer and producer theory covered in the prerequisite course, i.e. EC2101. It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework. After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games. Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm. Throughout the course, empirical observations and real-life cases pertaining to the issues discussed in this module are presented.",
