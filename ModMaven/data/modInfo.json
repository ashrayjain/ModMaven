Students examine how language constructs cultural abstractions such as social class, gender, and power relations and how these abstractions play out in language varieties and shape their defining characteristics. The module should appeal to students who wish to explore the interaction of language and society by drawing on linguistics, sociology, anthropology, and psychology, and to understand the practical implications of language variation for language policy and language education in multilingual societies such as Singapore.",

Very often misleading claims in science and in society more generally can arise from an ignorance of basic statistical ideas, but statistical methods can also be abused knowingly in fraudulent behaviour. On the other hand, statistical methods are also commonly used to detect and uncover fraud and dishonesty. After first looking at different kinds of deception involving data and the motivations for it this seminar will discuss the role of statistics in uncovering deception in areas such as: 1. Misleading claims in health; 2. Misleading surveys and opinion polls; 3. Claims and counterclaims in environmental science; 4. Fraud detection in the financial world; 5. Authorship disputes and detecting plagiarism It is intended that students gain an appreciation for basic statistical ideas for handling uncertainty as a key part of good scientific practice and decision making in society broadly.",

These are: the ability to conduct fieldwork; utilising a Southeast Asian language for academic study; and first-hand engagement with research methodological issues. The student is expected to develop more reflexive research capacity and present a seminar at the end of the course.",

As a result, the average Singapore resident is more familiar with plants from other parts of the world but not Singapore, which is a great shame. Native plants provide many ecosystem services for humans and ecological functions for native organisms. This module will help students appreciate the native flora and the importance of its conservation and sustainability. In addition, students will acquire basic botanical knowledge, the rudiments of plant identification and classification, as well as scientific reporting and presentation skills.",

The basic definition, applications and limitations of chemical engineering thermodynamics are first introduced followed by a review of basic laws, properties and concepts of thermodynamics. The application of basic concepts of energy conversion is extended to refrigeration and liquefaction processes. The development and discussion of thermodynamic property relations for systems of constant and variable compositions are covered in detail. The developed property relationships together with the basic laws are then applied to the analysis of the various equilibrium problems in chemical engineering such as vapour-liquid, vapour-liquid-liquid, liquid-liquid, solid-liquid and chemical reaction equilibria. This module is targeted at level 2 chemical engineering students.",

Topics will include specialised knowledge and skills in needs assessments and helping strategies specific to the context the student is placed for practicum. For example, in a hospital setting, topics will include the holistic psycho-social-medical approach to healing and wellness, healthcare policies and the dynamics of primary healthcare. It is a field practice module consisting of 400 hours of full-time fieldwork where students receive professional social work supervision for the equivalent of 10 weeks from May to August. Students are assessed on their fieldwork performance and a written assignment that relates theory to practice, with appropriate application of literature. The student assignment must be submitted by the designated date.",

Examining cultural icons from Japan's past and present we will unpack the assumptions, stereotypes, narrative strategies, and visualizing techniques of representing Japan. Students will probe one or more of Japan's three famous cultural icons - the samurai, the geisha, and/or the yakuza - as they appear in literature, visual and performance arts, and academic writings. By the end of the module students will not only have a richer understanding of the 'realities' behind such icons, but more significantly, they will be equipped to challenge stereotypes of Japan presented by journalism, popular culture, and the humanistic and social sciences. Ultimately such discovery will lead students to question their own knowledge of self and other. Students should refer to the module IVLE page for details of the selected icon(s) for the current semester.",

An introductory lecture series covers the basics in microbiology (bacteriology, virology, parasitology), immunology, vaccinology, and general principles of host-pathogen interactions. Selected diseases illustrate host-pathogens interactions along with the consequences for vaccine and drug design. The following set of lectures covered by clinicians and professionals focus on patient management, field study, as well as safety aspects when working with pathogens in a research lab. Tutorials are broken into \u201cjournal club\u201d, \u201carticle write-up exercise\u201d and \u201cproblem-based study\u201d and are directly related to the topics developed during the lectures.",

This module will focus on the theoretical foundations of digital modelling and performance simulation. It will enable students to develop a critical understanding of relevant digital tools and techniques, and the role that they can play in the design process. The theoretical understanding will be enhanced by hands-on experimentation with a subset of tools and techniques.",

In this module students will explore the beneficial side of animal toxins. They will find out information about how some of the life-saving drugs were designed and developed based on toxin structure through case studies in groups. They will also participate in discussions on toxinbased drugs for some of devastating diseases such as heart attack, stroke and cancer.

    "description": "This course aims to equip students with the basic working knowledge of contemporary economic thinking, and thus lays the foundation to many areas of their business studies in coming years. We adhere closely to mainstream economics thinking, but pay particular attention to business applications. We take our students through market equilibrium, competition, monopoly, price and non-price business strategies. Our teaching methodology takes a fundamentally problem-solving approach. Models and analytical skills are introduced in order to solve business problems systematically.Information technology and the Internet have made many changes in the way businesses are run, and Managerial Economics has changed significantly with it. We now devote a new portion of this course to discussing how network effects propel the information age, resulting in significant monopoly powers such as Microsoft. Related anti-trust and other cases are also discussed and analysed.",

Attempts to solve some number theoretic problems (such as the Fermats Last Theorem) often lead to new areas of mathematics. A recent application of an elementary number theoretic result called the Eulers Theorem to cryptography (RSA system) has further established the importance of this area in applied mathematics. The aim of this course is to introduce various topics in number theory and to connect these topics with algebra, analysis and combinatorics. Major topics: Prime numbers, multiplicative functions, theory of congruences, quadratic residues, algebraic numbers and integers, sums of squares and gauss sums, continued fractions, transcendental numbers, quadratic forms, genera and class group, partitions, diophantine equations, basic theory of elliptic curves",

By using examples in physical, engineering, biological and social sciences, we show how to convert real-world problems into mathematical equations through proper assumptions and physical laws. Qualitative analysis and analytical solutions for some models will be provided to interpret and explain qualitative and quantitative phenomena of the real-world problems. Major topics: Introduction of modelling; dynamic (or ODE) models: population models, pendulum motion; electrical networks, chemical reaction, etc; optimization and discrete models: profit of company, annuity, etc; probability models: president election poll, random walk, etc; Model analysis: dimensional analysis, equilibrium and stability, bifurcation, etc; and some typical applications.",

The diversity of life on earth will be explored, with discussions how life on earth possibly came about and how biologists try to classify and make sense of the diversity. The course will also introduce the concept of life functions from cells to tissues and from organs to systems. The concept of how organisms maintain their internal constancy and organisation of major organ systems will be discussed.

Our current environmental problems may arguably be said to ultimately trace their roots to (implicit) metaphysical assumptions, to cultural or religious attitudes towards the natural world, to ethical perspectives that do not accord moral consideration to non-humans.",

To alternative ways of conceiving life, experience, or reality? To traditional history? To alternative futures? To projections of, and apprehensions about human society? How does the imaginative construction of dystopias, in particular, address the constantly changing relation of science and technology to human life as we know it, to the human individual, to human society, and to the many institutions and notions, from gender and sexuality to race, family, nation, religion and species through which the relation of the individual to the group is mediated in time and place?

For example, the concept of \"price\" is generalized to include the value of time to the traveller. The demand for transporting freight is explained using the theory of the derived demand for an input, but the impact of modern approaches to management (e.g. logistics) is considered. Just as the concept of \"price\" requires modification, \"output\" too has many dimensions. In particular, this course will examine ways in which transport firms derive economies of scale when they operate in a network. It covers concepts of price discrimination, social cost benefit analysis and regulation. The course also uses case studies to provide important insights into the economics and management of different parts of the transport sector.",

Economic theory is applied to environmental questions associated with resource exploitation; the problem of externalities and their management through various economic institutions, economic incentives and other instruments and policies. Means of analysing the economic implications of environmental policy are also discussed as well as the valuation of environmental quality, assessment of environmental damages, and tools needed for the evaluation of projects such as cost-benefit analysis, and environmental impact assessments. Selected topics on international environmental issues will also be discussed.",

In today's information-oriented environment, a marketing manager cannot succeed without a thorough understanding of the research process. By understanding the research process, he can better judge the suitability, reliability and the validity of a research study in his decision-makings. Students will learn by doing in this course. While we will use class time to discuss appropriate research topics, students are required to do lots of activities by themselves in order to facilitate their learning by doing. In doing so, this course incorporates an experimental element in marketing research and consulting. As a marketing information provider, students will be assisting a firm by collecting and interpreting market data as a means toward the development of a superior marketing plan. At the same time, students will conduct tutorial activities that will provide opportunities for students to practice the key topics covered in the class. This course is intended to acquaint students with the fundamental marketing research process. More specifically, this course aims: (i) To familiarise the student with the fundamental marketing research skills of problem formulation, research design, questionnaire design, data collection, data analysis, and report presentation and writing. (ii) To have the student gain perspective and practice in applying these skills through a research project. (iii) To develop an understanding of decision making in marketing, its inherent difficulties and pitfalls and the importance of information in marketing research.",

A range of topics, including the role and tasks of an entrepreneur, store and non-store retailing, location and site selection, retail environment and the application of new technologies, retail marketing mix components (such as merchandising, pricing and margin planning, store management, layout and visual merchandising), as well as internal and external promotions will be covered. In addition, short case studies and projects will be used to supplement lectures and readings. Students will acquaint themselves with current and future retailing environments and developments in Singapore and other countries as well as the processes that go on behind the scenes in retailing. While the module will cover theories in retail marketing discipline, it is generally approached with a practical and applied orientation. Lectures will be supplemented with store visits, video clips and talks. Students will also get a chance to learn about assessing retail outlets and developing retail strategies for real-life businesses through hands-on projects. By the end of the course students should be equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to start up a retail business. Aside from business students who are interested in retailing, this course is targeted at students who are enterprising and may aspire to start their own retail business in the future.",

    "description": "The purpose of this seminar is to introduce students to the roles of randomness in scientific thinking. Some of the topics covered include the following: 1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren\u2019t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?",

We start with elementary probabilistic models and illustrate their applications in inventory management and financial engineering. We then construct discrete Markov chain models and demonstrate their applications in managing queues and for evaluating the performance measures of queueing systems. When analytical models are inadequate for studying real world random phenomena, simulation might be a feasible approach. We will discuss several well-known methods to simulate randomness.",

Individuals seeking coverage of their professional and personal risks have similar concerns. This course analyses the nature and impact of these risks and discusses appropriate risk management techniques. The emphasis is on the analysis and management of these problems for business entities, but these are substantial implications for the problems faced by individual and society.

The syllabus demonstrates the vexed significance of the \u201cpost\u201d in post-colonial cultural traditions. In tracing how decolonization remains bound up with older, colonial forms of knowledge/power, we approach post-coloniality as an aftermath. Through a range of writerly forms and cultural media, we identify the post-colonial in the question of \u201ctradition\u201d and its centrality to \u201cnon-Western\u201d modernity; in inscriptions of race/ethnicity/sexuality into Third World humanism; as the mourning for a vanishing past; as aesthetic resistance to homogenizing processes of modernization.",

It places these changes within a framework that considers Singapore's efforts to globalise and examines how policies are formulated with the idea of sustaining an economy that has integral links sub-regionally with Southeast Asia while developing new spatial linkages that will strengthen its position in the global network. Emphasis is also given to recent discussions about how diversity and difference in the perception and use of space pose a challenge to the utilitarian and functional definition adopted by the state.",

We uncover the ethical underpinnings of economics as commonly taught and practiced in its selection of topics, measurements and principles. We examine how incorporating ethical motivations in individual decision-making enriches economic models and explains important features in modern economies. We also look at how economics influences the value systems of participants in the economic system. Current issues in which economic considerations appear to be in conflict with ethics will be discussed.",

Students will be involved in writing short paragraphs, a short research report, and a summary analysis. Also, they will be taught principles of good writing and effective use of the dictionary. To prepare them for speaking at seminars and conferences, they will be trained to give oral presentations.

    "description": "Learning is a fundamental area of psychology and everyday life. This module focuses on how humans and other animals learn information, for example associations between different stimuli in their environment, or between their actions and the outcomes of those actions. The concepts of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning and instrumental (operant) conditioning will be introduced, alongside various learning phenomena (e.g. acquisition, extinction, spontaneous recovery, overshadowing, blocking, sensory preconditioning, latent inhibition). While some mathematical learning theories such as the Rescorla-Wagner model will be discussed, an effort will be made to relate these more abstract concepts to adaptive everyday life functioning as well as clinical issues such as anxiety disorders, addiction and behavioural therapy.",

Many of the life processes occurring in the plant cells are similar to that in animal cells. However, plant cells possess unique and distinctive properties. This course deals with the integration of different physiological phenomena and provides an understanding of different life processes in living plants. The effects of the environment on these different life functions will also be discussed. How such information can be applied to our benefit, for example increased plant productivity and the extension of shelf-life of produce will also be discussed.",

Central topics addressed will be privacy, surveillance, access, censorship, hacking, intellectual property, mediated identity, and digital rights. The question of how the concept of ethics has changed in the advent of the information society through humanist notions of technological instrumentalism, justice and dignity, and democracy, will be tackled as well. Through a strong focus on critical thinking, students will learn to engage with ethical ambivalences and controversies around everyday new media practices, as well as around the larger impact of communications processes and information technologies on society as a whole.",

It begins with exposition of Wesley Hohfeld\u2019s analysis of the different legal positions often designated as \u201crights\u201d; then uses Hohfeld\u2019s framework to understand the debate between interest and will theorists of rights. It moves on to explicit consideration of moral rights. Finally, applications are considered - including human rights, and Asian perspectives on \u201crights\u201d discourse.",

The course covers a variety of topics including globalization and inequality, forms of exchange, the politics of gender, ideas about sexuality and marriage, and issues of ethnicity and identity. Viewing these issues anthropologically means putting them into a comparative and historical perspective. The course is designed to show you how to see the connections between processes of changes at different levels - from your own life, to wider changes in Singapore and elsewhere in the world - via an anthropological perspective.",

Starting with \u2018how geographers view the world\u2019, the module offers a lens to analyse issues like climate change, urban flooding, human-environment relations, challenges of migration, cultural diffusion, economic integration and so forth. Each lecture will touch on contemporary scenarios and geographical analyses of issues. Students will also be exposed to field work techniques and strategies of project management in group discussions and project assignments. The goal is to develop students with strong \u2018geographical imaginations\u2019 better able to understand the world and all its complexities.",

The intermingling of people, the exchange of ideas and international commerce have been part of Southeast Asian life for centuries. This module surveys the broad currents of conflict, change and continuity across the region from a multidisciplinary perspective. It looks at how Southeast Asian societies and political systems have changed over time in response to the pressures of ecology, colonialism, nationalism, urbanization and globalization. The module also looks at the way ethnic, religious, national and regional identities have been constructed, used and altered over time. The overall objective is to provide students with an introduction to different ways of exploring Southeast Asia and different experiences of living in the region.",

It starts with two introductory chapters: a concise reminder of important facts and devices of classical optics; and a presentation of typical quantum phenomena that have been observed with light (entanglement, violation of Bell's inequalities, teleportation\u2026). The core of the module is the canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field and the introduction of the corresponding vector space (\u201cFock space\u201d) and field operators. Then, we present the main families of states (number, thermal, coherent, squeezed) and the most typical measurement techniques (photo-detection, homodyne measurement, first- and second-order coherence, Hong-Ou-\\Mandel bunching). The statistical nature of light fields is highlighted. Finally, we present the basic case studies of photon-atom interactions in the full quantum approach: cavity quantum electrodynamics (Janyes-Cummings model), spontaneous decay (Wigner-Weisskopf approach).",

Lecture topics include health hazards from drugs, naturally occurring toxins, industrial chemicals, or environmental toxicants; toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics; cellular and molecular mechanisms of toxicity; organ-selective toxicity; and safety evaluation of drugs and other chemicals. The general concepts will be illustrated with a number of both classical and highly topical examples.",

New and emerging techniques in research have pushed forward our understanding of physiology, pharmacology and pathology, paving the way for fundamental changes in diagnosis and treatment. As medical research has developed, it has also raised important questions for researchers, clinicians, legislators and the public. Important topics covered will include the progress and pitfalls of the human genome project and how advances in biochemistry have informed our understanding of human disease. The course will also cover revolutionary advances in neuroscience, the cardiovascular and metabolic system, and cancer, and how these have shaped our understanding of human disease. The transfer of information gathered in basic science research to the clinic will be examined, along with the impact this has had on society as a whole. Students will learn some of the basic scientific and clinical principles underlying these advances, and will examine how they are placed in a medical, social, legal and ethical context. Students will develop a better understanding of how science and medicine interact with society and the community.",

Students may expect to learn the merits and shortcoming of various theories and their applicability to Chinese languages as well as to other languages. This module seeks to equip students with the ability to develop and evaluate phonological analyses.",

Examples may include the three large collections of Chinese vernacular stories, Common Words to Warn the World (Jingshi tongyan), Constant Words to Awaken the World (Xingshi hengyan) and Clear Words to Inform the World (yushi mingyan), collected or written by Feng Menglong (1574-1646). Significant chapters from the three collections will be selected for intensive reading and close analysis. The reason for the rise of the vernacular story as well as the relationship between the author/editor and the stories will be discussed in the course. Some cases of the evolution from earlier versions to those collected in later periods will be explored. The narrative characteristics applied in the collections will be explained. Several thematic designs in the texts will also be interpreted.",

Organisational behavior is a field that draws ideas from psychology, social psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and management and applies them to the organisation. The field of organisational behaviour covers a wide range of topics: organisational culture, motivation, decision making, communication, work stress and so on. In the end, the field of organisational behavior asks two questions: (1) why do people behave as they do within organisations? (2) how can we use this information to improve the effectiveness of the organisation?",

It is the first of a two part series on introductory programming, which also includes CS1102S. This series is characterized by the use of a minimalist syntax of functional languages that enables an emphasis on fundamental programming issues. Topics covered include: overview of programming languages and compilation process, procedural abstraction, recursion, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, higher-order functions, state mutation, evaluation strategies, debugging and testing. Module activities include lectures, recitation, tutorial and laboratory exercises.",

Students will work in small groups to design and conduct an experiment using these methodologies and submit individual research reports. Prior background and interest in cognitive psychology will be very helpful.",

Some necessary background in mathematics and matrix analysis will be given before the foundations of the method are covered. Various applications to one- and two-dimensional problems in fluid flow, heat transfer and solid mechanics will be treated to reinforce the concepts. The precautions and points to note in the actual practice of FE analysis such as mesh design, modelling and verification will be covered. Some instruction in the use of a commercial Finite Element software will be given and students are expected to carry out one or more projects with it. This module should give students a good foundation before taking specialised modules in numerical simulation related to specific areas.",

It will examine the contemporary politics of South Asian states, focusing on their political culture, institutions and processes and political change and development. It will also treat issues like ethnicity, religion, regime legitimacy and the relationship between violence and democracy. By studying these issues comparatively we can discern regular patterns in the behaviour of individuals and groups and understand how their demands are processed and met. The second part of the module will adopt a thematic approach to explain the various factors that have shaped intra-regional relations. This will include the role of external powers and also the spillover effect of domestic conflicts. Foreign policy objectives of the regional states and their threat perceptions will be the principal area of focus. The module will also deal with issues of regional order and stability. The target students are those enrolled in South Asian Studies Programme and Political Science.",

The module starts with the introduction of various membranes and their applications. We then teach the general theory of membrane transport for pressure, concentration and electric field driven separation and purification processes. The basic principles of membrane fabrication for symmetric, asymmetric and composite membranes will be studied. Other focuses will be given to membrane fouling, liquid membranes, and facilitated transport in order to broaden students' knowledge in membrane usage and functional membranes. In order to inspire student interests in membrane applications for life science, the module will also include membranes for controlled release devices, biomimetic and biological membranes for life science.",

The focus is chiefly on painting and sculpture; the emphasis is on analyzing the composition or design of art works and in constructing meanings for them. The study of this module enables students to acquire critical skills for interpreting and connecting with works of art.

It is designed for non-physics students, and proceeds mainly by analogy and contrast with the familiar. Concepts will be emphasised, while omitting the technical details.",

Starting from simple single stage, binary separation, the theoretical treatment is extended to multi-component, multi-stage processes. After brief introduction to inter-phase mass transfer, basic concepts in rate-based design for the more important separation processes such as absorption and distillation are illustrated. The rate-based design concept is then extended to operations involving simultaneous heat and mass transfer such as in cooling tower and dryer. The process design principles are illustrated with distillation, absorption, extraction, adsorption, cooling tower and drying processes.",

Similarly, the meanings attached to monuments and memorials can change dramatically over time, as societies change and these structures are reinterpreted.",

    "description": "This module introduces students to skills necessary for writing an academic essay. It does so by facilitating students' ability to think critically about the relationship between the concepts of \"danger\" and \"national security\". In particular, it asks if the process by which danger is identified by national communities are unquestionable and self-evident, or if they are historically contigent and mutable. In this regard, is \"danger\" constructed to foster national solidarity and identity? This module examines different cultural and political texts attesting to the changing nature of the national security community, and uses them as the basis of teaching the elements of essay writing.",

Topics covered include a) Electricity and magnetism, where the basic concepts of electric and magnetic fields, forces on charged particles, electric potential, electromotive force, work and energy, are described. The properties of basic electrical circuits comprising resistors, inductors and capacitors are discussed, along with analysis of their transient and steady-state behaviour. Understanding the role of Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism is emphasized; b) Waves, introducing properties of waves, including geometric optics, propagation, interference and diffraction, and electromagnetic waves; and c) Quantum physics, where new physics concepts which led to the quantization of energy are introduced, leading to an explanation of atomic transitions, atomic spectra and the physical and the chemical properties of the atom. The uncertainty principle, wave-mechanics and wave particle duality concepts are covered, together with the use of wavefunctions in predicting the behaviour of trapped particles. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.",

We will seek to discern what palpable differences exist between primitive and modern people, and to confront the cultural and ethical conundrums entailed by those differences. Finally, we will explore how primitive people view modern society, and assess what the future may hold for native cultures in our fast globalizing world.",

The other part is policy-oriented. It applies tools from the basic theory part to everyday problems and scenarios and tries to assess market efficiency and effects of possible intervention by the government or regulatory agencies. The two parts proceed simultaneously. Real-life problems or scenarios are introduced and while discussing them the required theory is developed. Students must be able to take derivatives and solve optimization problems and think critically in a logical manner.",

In the process of developing these tools, we will discuss the determinants of consumption and investment. Next we turn to different business cycle theories. Specifically, we study the Keynesian, New Keynesian, Neo Classical and Real Business Cycle models, and examine their different assumptions and policy prescriptions for macroeconomic stabilization. IS-LM and AD-AS frameworks are employed in studying some or all of these paradigms. Finally, we evaluate the predictions of these models against business cycle facts. We will also briefly review national income accounting and discuss some measurement issues.",

Realizing how much of human cognition is language-dependant, we then explore the relations between language, cognition and culture by looking at such everyday linguistic phenomena as code-switching, metaphor and gesture. Augmenting the reading of sociolinguistic and cognitive science texts in this module, students will also learn how to collect and to analyze empirical evidence of language phenomena in order to more critically assess the claims of such texts.",

Also considered are: relationships between chamber music and its socio-political and cultural contexts; the changing social function of chamber music and musicians; various performance contexts; trends in musical aesthetics; and the evolution of chamber music\u2019s languages and styles. Students undertake a significant research project into a chamber work for their instrument, and lead discussions and perform in research seminars on that work. Students acquire the skills, knowledge, and confidence necessary to the critical appraisal of, and independent research into the repertoire they play.",

The module will deal with the subject of human perception in the reading and understanding of design. Issues related to space, form, order will serve as essential design generators. The module will also provide the requisite grounding in visual language, design thinking and graphic communication. Graphic communication will include basic drawing skills and the use of common rendering media for two and three-dimensional representation.",

Students will learn what an argument is, what the difference between validity and soundness is, and what it means to say that an argument is valid in virtue of its form. They will also be introduced to various strategies and pitfalls in reasoning. In addition, to hone their analytical skills, students will be given arguments\u2014drawn from philosophy and other areas\u2014to unpack and evaluate. It is hoped that in the process of learning what counts as good reasoning, one will become a better reasoner.",

As preliminaries, a number of relevant physical-chemical concepts are introduced. Since many liquid syntheses are metal-mediated, emphasis is given to homogeneous catalysis and modified heterogeneous. This naturally leads to a host of important environmental issues.

At its core lies the oeuvre of Thomas Pynchon, whose novels will be read as a critical meta-narrative of the informational turn in Western society since the 1960s. Besides obvious technological effects and the accelerated exchange it enables, how has the new, informational paradigm affected our psychology, everyday life and work; our understandings of place and community, of history and culture? Rather than placing Pynchon within a literary canon, seminars will be thematic studies, drawing on a wide range of critical theory, cultural history, and critiques of globalisation and technology.",

Driven by advances in hardware, software and communications, the very nature of market research is rapidly changing. New techniques are emerging. The increased velocity of information flow enables marketers to respond with much greater speed to changes in the marketplace. Market research is timelier, less expensive, more actionable and more precise ... all of which makes it of far greater importance to marketers. Applied Market Research is primarily designed for marketing professionals to train them to use market knowledge for day-to-day marketing decisions. It will provide good understanding of many prevalent research techniques and their application. The course will be taught in an application-oriented fashion through lectures, class discussions and case studies. Students will acquire critical analysis and decision making abilities to prepare them to tackle the marketing and business issues they are likely to confront in a career in marketing.",

It attempts to develop a theoretical foundation for choice under uncertainty, portfolio analysis and equilibrium asset pricing models. A considerable portion of the course will also be devoted to the fixed-income securities and derivative securities. Since this is an economics course in a liberal arts and sciences setting, we will emphasize economic concepts whenever possible, and spend time on the intellectual and economic development of investment analysis.",

It also allows students to engage with emerging issues that are likely to become focal points in shaping future debates among political geographers. The aim of the module is to explore the co-constitutive relationship between politics and space. As the political organization of society has spatial consequences, so too does geography influence our understanding of political relationships. These relations are negotiated and contested in multiple ways that cut across different locations, scales, and temporalities. Accordingly, we will examine political concerns, disputes, accommodations, and consequences from a geographical perspective, where students can expect to acquire a critical appreciation for the historical trajectories and evolving implications of states, sovereignty, territoriality, nationalism, colonialism, democracy, ethnic conflict, policing and crime, terrorism, war, environmental justice, and political activism.",

A portfolio approach is emphasised in relation to risk diversification and asset allocation. The relevance of CAPM and the APT asset pricing models and market efficiency for real estate investment will be examined, as would the role of real estate in a mixed asset portfolio, mean-variance optimisation techniques and unique aspects of real estate as an investment. In addition, issues in optimisation and correlation analysis, investment financing and performance measurement will be analysed. Targeted Students - Students in the M.Sc. (Real Estate) program.",

Whenever possible, films and case studies are used to supplement the textbook and readings, and a visit to the local Institute of Mental Health will usually be arranged.",

Although no background knowledge is assumed other than from the introductory psychology course, those with an interest in biological bases of behaviour or neuroscience will be advantaged. The course is intended primarily for students doing a single major in Psychology, and is designed as an introduction to those wishing to pursue advanced courses in Cognitive Neuroscience (PL3285 &amp; PL4206). The course will focus on key questions asked about the brain, such as: How is the brain organised? How do drugs affect our behaviour? How does the brain see, hear and produce movement? How does it learn and think? Clinical topics, such as Parkinson's Disease and schizophrenia will be integrated into the course, as will fMRI research methods and findings. Emphasis will be given to the key principles of nervous system function, however, the course still requires a lot of factual information to be assimilated and memorized.",

Analogy is an important factor in preparing, if not predicting, new concepts while an experience-based intuition can sometimes be an obstacle. The objective of this seminar module is to present case studies of the creative role of analogy in mathematics and of the ground-breaking importance of \"counter-intuition\" in modern mathematics. A wealth of examples of both can be found in geometry, number theory, analysis, algebra, logic, set theory and theoretical computer science. Students of this module are expected to source for relevant material in books, journals and the internet under the guidance of the lecturer. The emphasis, however, will be on the spirit of the mathematical enterprise rather than on the technical mastery. To illustrate the use of analogy and intuition in problem solving, some elementary problems and puzzles will be posed in class for attempt and discussion. The main prerequisite for this module is an inquiring mind open to new ideas.

This is followed by an initiation into the concepts of classical probability, paving the way for the important topics of random variables and probability distributions. Next, the core ideas of classical statistical inference are introduced - including sampling distributions, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing and analysis of variance. Finally, correlation and regression analyses will be covered.",

We examine the tensions between fieldwork, the crafting of the text (the ethnography), and its reception within the discipline of anthropology. Following the `writing culture' debate, we aim to understand how ethnographers `construct' data, frame their analysis, and produce a text. We examine ethnographic `realism' as a style, how styles have changed over time, and how differently some researchers have written about the same culture area. The course will heighten students' critical skills and their awareness of how any representation of social reality has been put together.",

The lectures will demonstrate how various mathematical instruments, such as stochastic analysis, stochastic control, partial differential equations, numerical methods, etc, can be used to solve practical problems in quantitative finance. Modeling, numerical implementation and the interplay between theoretical and modeling approaches will be emphasized. In particular, examples from current and/or past developments in financial markets will be chosen for illustrations of applications of theory and modeling techniques introduced. The actual topics covered may vary from year to year, and will be decided by the lecturers.",

But the significance of its impact on the structure of the region's 'contemporary' history is more debatable, for revisionist historians are wont to discount the thesis that the War represented a significant turning point or watershed which 'transformed' the region's history. Drawing on both country and regional perspectives, this module first assesses the impact of the War on the theme of decolonization, perhaps the one major historically significant process to dominate the region's political terrain in the immediate post-war aftermath. It will further examine the challenges and trials confronting the new states &quot;after&quot; decolonization, in particular, their search not only for new political frameworks to replace the colonial structures they had discarded, but also for solutions to mitigate the issues of social integration, inter-state conflict and regional co-operation.",

Selection will include text and passage from short stories, journals, magazines, and newspapers, as well as audio-visual materials such as TV programs, feature films, etc. The range of readings is intended, firstly, to broaden students' vocabulary and familiarize them with terms relating to many fields of endeavor.

It also enables students to practice and improve the skills of technical report writing and oral presentation. The objective of the design project is to provide an opportunity for students to gain practical experience in an actual industry problem. It also gives the students a broader scope in applying industrial engineering concepts rather than concentrating on one particular subject area.",

Yet, as we all know, the evolution of Singapore, from classical regional emporium to international port city and strategic naval base, has all along been defined by much larger regional and international forces. After its emergence as a sovereign state in 1965, Singapore continues to project itself as a 'global city-state'. Our local society has an 'international' make-up, being the product as it were of historical and current diasporic trends. This module provides an international framework for a study of the history of Singapore, and seeks to examine the historical evolution of Singapore against the contexts of regional and international changes and developments from the 14th to the 20th century. This module is open to all students throughout NUS interested in Singapore history/studies.",

Are they speculation or fact? How do we know? Of what use are they? How have they shaped our lives? In this module we will retrace the key ideas that led Einstein to his formulation of the Special Theory of Relativity, and how the concepts evolved through various personalities to produce the elegant spacetime version of the theory, culminating in the General Theory of Relativity. Along the way we will see the practical application of the scientific method and clarify common misconceptions of the theory. We will also study the impact Relativity has had on science, technology, philosophy and culture, and have a peek at the research frontier, where gravity and quantum theory meet, to be aware of open problems. Synopsis Einstein\u2019s insight was that time must be relative, in contrast to Newton\u2019s assumption of an absolute time. Time dilation (\u201cmoving clocks run slow\u201d) is easily derived from Einstein\u2019s postulates and it immediately implies a range of related effects such as the relativity of simultaneity and length contraction. These phenomena are seen to be interconnected through the formulation of a Minkowskian spacetime, which unites, and generalizes, Euclid\u2019s space with Newton\u2019s time. A further generalization leads to the General Theory of Relativity which shows gravity to be an effect of a dynamical curved spacetime, the framework for cosmology.",

In the first section, we discuss the solution of simple stochastic rational expectations models, and examine the main features of, and the key issues in the controversy between, the new classical, real business cycle, and Keynesian-New- Keynesian schools of thought. Topics covered include the Lucas, Sargent-Wallace and Fischer (overlapping wage contract) models, as well as the Shapiro-Stiglitz efficiency wage model and Romer's menu cost - coordination failure model. In the second section, various inter-temporal optimization models are analysed, and their salient economic lessons discussed. Topics covered include a two-period model, overlapping-generations models with certain and uncertain lifetimes, Hall's life-cycle-permanent-income model, as well as optimal control models of investment behaviour and endogenous growth. A lecture on some principal macroeconomic features of the Singapore Economy concludes the course.",

Most of the examples presented require a certain degree of mathematical manipulation, as compared to a first course in electricity and magnetism. The introduction consists of a revision of the laws of electric and magnetic fields in vacuo and multipole expansion. The properties of fields in dielectric and magnetic materials are discussed in some detail. Following a review of magnetic induction, the formulation of Maxwell's equations is presented. Some important implications are discussed, together with applications of Maxwell's equations to boundary value problems and waveguides. Electromagnetic waves and retarded potentials are introduced, and illustrated with dipolar radiating systems. The course stops short of the relativistic treatment of electrodynamics.",

After a discussion of the various versions of Bernoulli's equation and the concept of vorticity, the study of fluid flows starts with the potential flows, with an application to the theory of airfoils. The theory of irrotational water waves is then presented to illustrate dispersive wave propagation and the hyperbolic tendency to form shocks. The balance of these two tendencies produces soliton solutions. The concept of flow similarity is applied to the study of boundary layer. The phenomenon of boundary layer separation is discussed. The concept of hydrodynamic instability is illustrated with the Rayleigh-Benard convection problem. The chaotic dynamics of the related Lorenz equation is then presented. A brief introduction to turbulence closes the module.",

    "description": "Business decisions are often made under uncertainty. In the modern business environment, technological advances facilitate the collection of huge amounts of data which can potentially improve the decision making process. Successful businesses make use of Business Analytics and Business Intelligence, which are fundamentally based on quantitative statistical methods, to identify patterns and trends in their data which eventually lead to insightful projections and realistic predictions. This module introduces students to the fundamental concepts of statistical inference such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, as well as to statistical tools useful in business analysis, such as regression analysis and time series analysis.",

The operations function therefore not only affects final product quality but also impacts customer service and the overall competitiveness of the organisation. The objective of this course is to introduce and highlight the strategic importance of operations, and the fundamental principles and concepts of effective operations management. Students will examine how operations decisions in areas such as quality, process design, capacity and inventory can be managed, controlled and improved. Operations in both manufacturing and service organisations will be addressed.(Although no prerequisite is stated, this module assumes prior knowledge of basic probability concepts like expected value, variance, normal distribution, and Poisson distribution. Students should ensure that they are adequately prepared for this module.)",

The science of drug action (pharmacology) will include two major areas of pharmacology, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, which provide the scientific foundation for the study of drug actions. In dealing with the therapeutic applications of drug actions, examples of commonly used drugs for specific disease states will be discussed, and their possible side-effects highlighted. The examples will illustrate the use of over-the-counter as well as prescription drugs.",

After introducing the basic terminology and a classification of fluid and flow, the students are taught fluid statics, which cover hydrostatic forces on submerged bodies, surface tension forces, buoyancy, metacentric height and stability of floating bodies. Numerous examples of engineering application pertaining to each aspect of fluid statics are presented. In the section on fluid dynamics, basic principles of fluid motion are introduced. This covers the continuity equation, Bernoulli and energy equations, and free-surface flows including hydraulic jumps. The momentum equation and its engineering application using the control volume approach are included. The section on flow measurements introduces students to a variety of common instrumentation that are used in pressure, velocity and volumetric measurements, and this is reinforced with laboratory experiments. In the analysis of engineering results, the dimensional analysis and similitude are taught, with engineering examples. This is a core module.",

    "description": "This module requires students to reflect on and further develop the intellectual dimension of their academic, professional or social interests. It revolves around a series of talks given by invited speakers, organised into three strands: (i) the academic strand, which introduces various areas and modes of academic inquiry; (ii) the professional strand, which introduces various professions and looks into the nature of the knowledge society; (iii) the social strand, which examines an individual's intellectual and social engagement with the increasingly interdependent world. Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions. The module reinforces skills learnt in Writing and Critical Thinking, and allows students to apply them to a diverse range of issues. Assessed on a CS/CU basis, the 4-MC module is completed in two semesters (student's Semester 2 &amp; 3). Students are required to attend at least nine talks (minimum four per semester), participate actively in discussion, and submit four short response papers and two longer papers. Students will have to perform satisfactorily in each of these assessment modes. No partial MC will be given. Registration for this one-year long module will be opened for a new intake of first-year students only in Semester 2 of each academic year.",

Students also learn data sampling and analysis, hypothesis testing and experimental design essential for today?s chemical and environmental engineers. This course covers the formulation of process models and necessary numerical techniques for solving the model equations arising in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, reaction engineering, transport phenomena, and process systems engineering. The numerical techniques include methods for solving systems of linear and non-linear algebraic equations and systems of linear and non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations. Direct and iterative techniques, numerical differentiation and integration, error propagation, convergence and stability analysis are taught, followed by basic concepts of probability, discrete and continuous random variables, expected values, joint probability distributions, and independence. Hypothesis testing, least square regression, experimental design and sensitivity analysis are also introduced. This module is targeted at level 3 chemical and environmental engineering students.",

In the module, non-fiction film is used as tool to explore critical issues of the nature of reality, subjectivity/objectivity, selection bias, and the manipulation of data \u2013 which are broad based concerns in all academic disciplines. The module draws upon literature from a wide range of disciplines from visual anthropology and new media, to film studies to contextualize the diversity of theoretical and practical approaches involved in creating non-fiction film.

The topics taught will cover an understanding of the nature of the genetic material and the passage of information from DNA to protein, as well as the major technologies currently used for genetic engineering. Examples of genetic engineering of micro-organisms, plants and animals will be given in detail, and cloning will also be discussed. The students will become aware of the impact of the various genome projects on their own lives and will also able to recognise difficulties associated with deciding which kinds of genetic engineering are ethically and morally acceptable.",

It will explore traditional and more modem views on what constitute an adequate and healthy diet. The composition of food along with potential contaminants of food will be examined and how an individual needs to consider their diet in relation to specific needs. The aim will be to educate the students on the need for and the composition of a healthy diet and how to obtain this and remain healthy during the important years of development in early adulthood. There is now much more emphasis on the role of food in preventative medicine and how a well balanced diet can keep one fit and healthy. It is necessary to be aware of the composition of various foods and how different methods of processing and cooking may affect the compositional quality of the product.",

Prior to this series of lectures focusing on specific areas, a detailed introduction of the EE curriculum will also be given in the first lecture. The philosophy underpinning the curriculum and its strength and constraints will be highlighted. The module will conclude with student presentations on a topic in an area of their interest.

The social milieus in which the drama evolved are examined, and the illusionary world which ancient theatergoers imagined are reconstructed. The module treats dramatic literature as a vital component of living theatre, not as reading material, and thus complements TS3237, which teaches the staging practices of Asian theatre. Towards the end of the semester, Western canonical dramaturgy serves as a comparative reference to Asian materials, which enhances intercultural study or practice in other modules.",

We will explore whether brain imaging techniques have illuminated what each part of the brain actually does, and how these different parts interact functionally, before finally discussing recent applications of such findings. Two currently popular application areas are brain-machine/computer interfaces (using brain-waves to directly control robotic devices) and creating new &quot;sensory abilities&quot; in those people who have sensory impairments (e.g., the blind or deaf). The style of the course will be an informal one, and the &quot;lectures&quot; should be treated more like seminars/discussions. The emphasis will therefore rely heavily on preparation work outside the lectures that culminates in a fruitful debate during the lectures. To facilitate this style, several lectures will begin with students' critiques of research articles before &quot;opening up the floor&quot; for general discussion.",

It looks at how Southeast Asian societies and political systems have changed over time in response to the pressures of ecology, colonialism, nationalism, urbanization and globalization. The module also looks at the way ethnic, religious, national and regional identities have been constructed, used and altered over time.

The module will introduce students to major episodes of financial crises in history, with particular emphasis on crises in emerging and developing countries since the 1970s, the Great Depression, and the financial collapse of 2007-09. The focus of the module is in delineating the causal connections among inequality, class politics, accumulation patterns, the ascent of finance, globalization, and financial crises. The module surveys how financial crises affect domestic and international politics.",

Remembering is always a selective reconstruction, hence always political. 'Popular' (often oral) memory interacts with 'official' history, while itself containing differences relating to generation, class, gender and ethnicity. Memories of traumatic events of the C20th shape our moral universe and are driving developments in international human rights law. Our explorations of the politics of memory will be grounded in case studies of both regional and global relevance.",

Every day, we are faced with news that human development and consumption come at a cost to the environment. There are 7 billion people living on Earth today and our demand for resources exerts an extraordinary mount of pressure on the planet and our environment. Globally biodiversity is disappearing through habitat destruction, overfishing and mining. Rivers, lakes and seas are polluted by sewerage and marine debris; soot and smoke pollute the air we breathe. Singapore is geographically located in one of the most biodiversity-rich areas in the world, but Southeast Asia is losing a large quantity of its natural resources due to anthropogenic effects. Through this module, students are introduced to a variety of nterdisciplinary topics related to environmental issues today.",

It is well recognized by the world\u2019s scientific, industrial and political communities that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has been steadily increasing due to human activities and economic development, which accelerates the greenhouse effect. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mandated a reduction of CO2 emission levels to below those of 1990. To reduce the CO2 emission and maintain a desired balance in atmosphere, new technologies have been developed. CO2 capture and storage is one of the approaches. It is also possible to convert CO2 to some reusable hydrocarbons or chemicals through physical, chemical and biological processes. The most important challenge is how to activate CO2 economically as it has high thermodynamic stability. Solar energy should be one of the best candidates because it is totally clean and abundant. Consequently, the highly efficient and selective photochemical reduction systems for CO2 are highly desired. In addition, alternative energy resources and technologies also play vital roles in the reduction of CO2 emission.",

Our starting point is a conception of ourselves as free and conscious beings equipped with bodies that allow us to observe and explore a familiar external world. Successive lectures investigate alternative conceptions of the human condition, such as ones in which we are unfree, or non-spirituous, or inhabit a world whose fundamental nature is hidden from our view. Different conceptions bear differently on the further question of what we should value and why. Discussion is both argument-driven and historically informed.",

Using cases from around the globe, students will be exposed to the very broad perspective offered by comparative and historical analysis. The course will initiate thinking about social welfare options and citizenship in a globalized world. Through historical and comparative analyses, critical questions about the role of the state in welfare provisions, economic development, and democratic development will be examined.

The students will conduct independent reading, research, discussion, and/or writing under the direction of the faculty member. The course grade is usually based on a written report and two seminars covering the research. The teaching objective of the module is for faculty members with expertise in relevant fields of chemical research to impart knowledge on, provide guidance to and stimulate creative thinking of students with interest in modern chemistry. The students are expected to gain in-depth understanding of the chosen topic through discussions/meetings with the faculty members, his/her own research work, and preparation and presentation of written/oral reports. Each student is assigned at least one adviser from the faculty. The student should meet with his/her adviser at the beginning of the semester. The adviser and student will select a topic for investigation within the advisers area of expertise. For example, the assignment might require the students to read some recent journal articles or chapters in selected books. During subsequent meetings, the student and adviser will discuss the material and related issues. The student will then prepare a brief written report summarizing the background and significance of the problem under consideration, the approaches used to solve the problem, and the results of the investigations reported in the articles or books. The written report is due at the end of the semester. The student will also be required to make two oral presentations (one around the middle of the semester, and another one at the end of the semester) to show his or her understanding of the problem, and what he or she has read.",

Moreover, as a result of the expansion of global urban population, more food needs to be produced, moved to cities and distributed; insufficient food supply and inefficient food distribution systems will result in higher food prices. The global demand for more food results in the globalization of the food supply, increasing the risk of spreading food-borne diseases across international borders. Recent stories about tainted strawberries, infected chickens, mad cow disease, for instance, have increased public concern on the need of a safe food supply. By the end of this course, the students should be able to understand the causes and current character of food insecurity, the essentials of food safety, factors affecting global food supply, and the effects of biotechnology on a secure and safe food supply.",

The course will begin with a brief introduction to India\u2019s legal system, the Constitution and the judiciary so as to set the tone. This part will also contain an evaluation of the changes since 1991 to India\u2019s economic policies that have made it an emerging economic superpower. Thereafter, it will deal with the core through a discussion of the legal aspects involved in setting up business operations in India, the different types of business entities available, shareholders\u2019 rights, joint ventures, raising finance both privately and by accessing public capital markets, and the regimes relating to foreign direct investment, corporate governance, mergers and acquisitions and corporate bankruptcy. Where applicable, the course will provide relevant comparisons with similar laws in other jurisdictions such as the U.S., the U.K. and Singapore. While the course is not intended to involve an exhaustive study of all applicable laws and regulations, it will highlight key legal considerations for business transactions in India and allow for deliberation on topical, contemporary issues with real-world examples.",

    "description": "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of Evolution This bold statement by the Russian population geneticist T. Dobzhansky emphasizes the importance of evolution as the only unifying concept in biology. Yet, the theory of evolution is more controversial and opposed by more forces in society than any other theory in science. The module will revisit many of these objections and reveal that they are based on reasoning that is incompatible with the principles of science. We will investigate, why it is \"Neo-Darwinism\" and not \"Intelligent Design\" that is currently the best supported paradigm for explaining \"adaptation.\" We will then challenge the power of the neo-Darwinian paradigm by asking how seemingly incompatible phenomena like altruism and excessive male ornamentation can possibly be explained by natural selection. We will also study several key events in evolution such as the origin of sex and its numerous consequences and the origin of the human species. We will conclude with discussing the importance of the theory of evolution for understanding cultural evolution (\"memes\") and human health and senescence (\"Darwinian medicine\").",

    "description": "This module aims to promote the better understanding about Japan's foreign policy and international relations. The module consists of three analytical focuses: defence and security policies, foreign economic policy and regional and multilateral institutions. The first section highlights major features of Japan's defence and security policies including the recent changes in Japan's security environment in the Asia Pacific region and their impact on Japan's defence policy approaches. The second section focuses on the characteristics of Japan's policies of international trade and foreign aid. This section also discusses the domestic system in the context of Japan's foreign economic policy and highlights how the Western critics regarded the issue as problematic. The third section examines Japan's approaches to regional institutions such as APEC, ARF, ASEAN+3, and the G-8 Summit Meeting and United Nations, with focuses on its approaches and diplomatic activities in each case. Although this module highlights more empirical cases of Japanese foreign policy, it also introduces some theoretical debates as well.",

The module aims to provide an introduction to the field of quantum computing. While very much a technology of the future, the module will examine some of the possibilities that the quantum world offers in advancing the capabilities of computers and how our notion of information has evolved. Essentially the module showcases, two major paradigm shifts; one from classical physics to quantum physics and the other from the standard Turing principle in computer science to its modern quantum counterpart.",

The course will focus on the fundamental notions of constraint satisfaction problems, local consistency, constraint propagation, complete and incomplete constraint solvers, and various search methods.",

The course will begin with a brief exploration of the bases of cognition, including the topics of neurophysiology, sensation and perception, and cognitive science/psychology. Using this as a basis, the course will go on to explore biases in decision making, the role of emotion in cognition and cognitive styles, persuasion and influence, conformity and obedience, sensemaking and cognition in high-stress/high-reliability environments, cognition in groups and teams, ethical decision-making, and the importance of understanding what makes us happy... the latter of which is often difficult for us to predict and has implications for our (inevitable) lives as employees in organizations. Throughout the course an attempt will be made to understand the way students think, the biases they hold when making decisions and interpreting environmental stimuli in the context of organisations, and the ways in which their emotions influence their decisions and judgments. Also highlighted will be the usefulness of introspection and an awareness of their own thought processes and assumptions... an aim that almost all religions and many academic pursuits attempt forward, yet one which is often excluded from the study of business to the detriment of business people.",

This module will start with bioenergetics which stresses on the application of thermodynamics to physiological processes in both animals and plants. Six types of energy will be dealt with, concerning (1) the transformation of light energy to chemical energy by plants, (2) the transformation of chemical energy to chemical potential energy of ions and water across bio-membranes, (3) the transformation of chemical potential energy to electrical energy by plasmalemma with special emphasis on neurons, (4) the transformation of chemical energy to mechanical energy by muscle, and (5) the production and release of heat during energy transformation. Since neurons and muscle tissues require a relatively constant extracellular environment for them to function properly, the important concept of homeostasis will be discussed. Emphasis will be on extracellular fluid volume and composition. In addition, mechanisms involved in the balance of heat gain and heat loss to maintain a constant body temperature will be covered.",

    "description": "This module is an introduction to analysis in the setting of metric spaces. There are at least two advantages by adopting this slightly abstract point of view. First of all, it helps to crystallize fundamental concepts and elucidate the roles they play in the theory. Secondly, it provides a unified framework for applications of the results and techniques of mathematical analysis. This module will cover the basic theory of metric spaces and sample applications to other areas of mathematics. It is highly recommended to students majoring in pure mathematics and to those who are interested in applied mathematics with an analytical flavour. Major topics: Euclidean spaces, inner product and Euclidean norm. Metric spaces: definition, examples. Topological concepts: open sets and closed sets, subspaces, density and separability. Convergence of sequences, completeness, nowhere dense sets, Baires category theorem and applications. Continuity of functions and uniform continuity. Compactness: open covers, Heine-Borel Theorem, extreme value theorem. Equivalences of compactness, sequential compactness, and completeness and total boundeness. Connectedness, characterizations of subintervals of the real line, intermediate value theorem, path-connectedness. Contraction mappings, Banachs fixed point theorem and applications. Function spaces: pointwise and uniform convergence for sequences and series of functions, Weierstrass M-test, boundedness and equicontinuity, Arzela-Ascoli Theorem. Weierstrass Approximation Theorem and applications.",

We next examine the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, and simple inflation-unemployment dynamics. We also study further policy issues (time inconsistency, Ricardian Equivalence, profit-sharing), open-economy macroeconomics (the Mundell-Fleming model), and simple growth theory (the Solow model and the AK endogenous growth model).",

    "description": "This module is a continuation of the foundation module on microeconomics. It is designed to equip students with the standard tools and techniques to analyze microeconomic issues and to prepare them to access higher level modules that utilize microeconomic analysis. The module begins with a review of several foundation topics on consumer and producer theory covered in the prerequisite course, i.e. EC2101. It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework. After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games. Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm. Throughout the course, empirical observations and real-life cases pertaining to the issues discussed in this module are presented.",

As such, the module combines creative and critical practice, and features a variety of reflective, analytical and practical assessment tasks, including a group performance project.",
